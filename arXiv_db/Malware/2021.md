<summary>2021-01-02 22:04:22 - Improving DGA-Based Malicious Domain Classifiers for Malware Defense with Adversarial Machine Learning</summary>

- *Ibrahim Yilmaz, Ambareen Siraj, Denis Ulybyshev*

- `2101.00521v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00521v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00521v1)

> Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are used by adversaries to establish Command and Control (C\&C) server communications during cyber attacks. Blacklists of known/identified C\&C domains are often used as one of the defense mechanisms. However, since blacklists are static and generated by signature-based approaches, they can neither keep up nor detect never-seen-before malicious domain names. Due to this shortcoming of blacklist domain checking, machine learning algorithms have been used to address the problem to some extent. However, when training is performed with limited datasets, the algorithms are likely to fail in detecting new DGA variants. To mitigate this weakness, we successfully applied a DGA-based malicious domain classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method with a novel feature engineering technique. Our model's performance shows a higher level of accuracy compared to a previously reported model from prior research. Additionally, we propose a new method using adversarial machine learning to generate never-before-seen malware-related domain families that can be used to illustrate the shortcomings of machine learning algorithms in this regard. Next, we augment the training dataset with new samples such that it makes training of the machine learning models more effective in detecting never-before-seen malicious domain name variants. Finally, to protect blacklists of malicious domain names from disclosure and tampering, we devise secure data containers that store blacklists and guarantee their protection against adversarial access and modifications.

<summary>2021-01-04 14:54:20 - Echelon: Two-Tier Malware Detection for Raw Executables to Reduce False Alarms</summary>

- *Anandharaju Durai Raju, Ke Wang*

- `2101.01015v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01015v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01015v1)

> Existing malware detection approaches suffer from a simplistic trade-off between false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) due to a single tier classification approach, where the two measures adversely affect one another. The practical implication for malware detection is that FPR must be kept at an acceptably low level while TPR remains high. To this end, we propose a two-tiered learning, called ``Echelon", from raw byte data with no need for hand-crafted features. The first tier locks FPR at a specified target level, whereas the second tier improves TPR while maintaining the locked FPR. The core of Echelon lies at extracting activation information of the hidden layers of first tier model for constructing a stronger second tier model. Echelon is a framework in that it allows any existing CNN based model to be adapted in both tiers. We present experimental results of evaluating Echelon by adapting the state-of-the-art malware detection model ``Malconv" in the first and second tiers.

- *Giorgio Severi, Jim Meyer, Scott Coull, Alina Oprea*

- `2003.01031v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01031v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01031v3)

> Training pipelines for machine learning (ML) based malware classification often rely on crowdsourced threat feeds, exposing a natural attack injection point. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of feature-based ML malware classifiers to backdoor poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on challenging "clean label" attacks where attackers do not control the sample labeling process. We propose the use of techniques from explainable machine learning to guide the selection of relevant features and values to create effective backdoor triggers in a model-agnostic fashion. Using multiple reference datasets for malware classification, including Windows PE files, PDFs, and Android applications, we demonstrate effective attacks against a diverse set of machine learning models and evaluate the effect of various constraints imposed on the attacker. To demonstrate the feasibility of our backdoor attacks in practice, we create a watermarking utility for Windows PE files that preserves the binary's functionality, and we leverage similar behavior-preserving alteration methodologies for Android and PDF files. Finally, we experiment with potential defensive strategies and show the difficulties of completely defending against these attacks, especially when the attacks blend in with the legitimate sample distribution.

<summary>2021-01-13 05:46:44 - Towards Interpretable Ensemble Learning for Image-based Malware Detection</summary>

- *Yuzhou Lin, Xiaolin Chang*

- `2101.04889v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04889v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04889v1)

> Deep learning (DL) models for image-based malware detection have exhibited their capability in producing high prediction accuracy. But model interpretability is posing challenges to their widespread application in security and safety-critical application domains. This paper aims for designing an Interpretable Ensemble learning approach for image-based Malware Detection (IEMD). We first propose a Selective Deep Ensemble Learning-based (SDEL) detector and then design an Ensemble Deep Taylor Decomposition (EDTD) approach, which can give the pixel-level explanation to SDEL detector outputs. Furthermore, we develop formulas for calculating fidelity, robustness and expressiveness on pixel-level heatmaps in order to assess the quality of EDTD explanation. With EDTD explanation, we develop a novel Interpretable Dropout approach (IDrop), which establishes IEMD by training SDEL detector. Experiment results exhibit the better explanation of our EDTD than the previous explanation methods for image-based malware detection. Besides, experiment results indicate that IEMD achieves a higher detection accuracy up to 99.87% while exhibiting interpretability with high quality of prediction results. Moreover, experiment results indicate that IEMD interpretability increases with the increasing detection accuracy during the construction of IEMD. This consistency suggests that IDrop can mitigate the tradeoff between model interpretability and detection accuracy.

- *Cengiz Acarturk, Melih Sirlanci, Pinar Gurkan Balikcioglu, Deniz Demirci, Nazenin Sahin, Ozge Acar Kucuk*

- `2101.05646v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05646v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05646v1)

> Malicious software threats and their detection have been gaining importance as a subdomain of information security due to the expansion of ICT applications in daily settings. A major challenge in designing and developing anti-malware systems is the coverage of the detection, particularly the development of dynamic analysis methods that can detect polymorphic and metamorphic malware efficiently. In the present study, we propose a methodological framework for detecting malicious code by analyzing run trace outputs by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We developed models of run traces of malicious and benign Portable Executable (PE) files. We created our dataset from run trace outputs obtained from dynamic analysis of PE files. The obtained dataset was in the instruction format as a sequence and was called Instruction as a Sequence Model (ISM). By splitting the first dataset into basic blocks, we obtained the second one called Basic Block as a Sequence Model (BSM). The experiments showed that the ISM achieved an accuracy of 87.51% and a false positive rate of 18.34%, while BSM achieved an accuracy of 99.26% and a false positive rate of 2.62%.

<summary>2021-01-15 09:41:05 - RAICC: Revealing Atypical Inter-Component Communication in Android Apps</summary>

- *Jordan Samhi, Alexandre Bartel, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Jacques Klein*

- `2012.09916v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09916v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09916v2)

> Inter-Component Communication (ICC) is a key mechanism in Android. It enables developers to compose rich functionalities and explore reuse within and across apps. Unfortunately, as reported by a large body of literature, ICC is rather "complex and largely unconstrained", leaving room to a lack of precision in apps modeling. To address the challenge of tracking ICCs within apps, state of the art static approaches such as Epicc, IccTA and Amandroid have focused on the documented framework ICC methods (e.g., startActivity) to build their approaches. In this work we show that ICC models inferred in these state of the art tools may actually be incomplete: the framework provides other atypical ways of performing ICCs. To address this limitation in the state of the art, we propose RAICC a static approach for modeling new ICC links and thus boosting previous analysis tasks such as ICC vulnerability detection, privacy leaks detection, malware detection, etc. We have evaluated RAICC on 20 benchmark apps, demonstrating that it improves the precision and recall of uncovered leaks in state of the art tools. We have also performed a large empirical investigation showing that Atypical ICC methods are largely used in Android apps, although not necessarily for data transfer. We also show that RAICC increases the number of ICC links found by 61.6% on a dataset of real-world malicious apps, and that RAICC enables the detection of new ICC vulnerabilities.

- `2006.11002v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11002v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11002v2)

> Due to the convenience of access-on-demand to information and business solutions, mobile apps have become an important asset in the digital world. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a First taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the Covid-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.

<summary>2021-01-15 15:29:02 - A Framework for Enhancing Deep Neural Networks Against Adversarial Malware</summary>

- *Deqiang Li, Qianmu Li, Yanfang Ye, Shouhuai Xu*

- `2004.07919v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07919v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07919v3)

> Machine learning-based malware detection is known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks. The state-of-the-art is that there are no effective defenses against these attacks. As a response to the adversarial malware classification challenge organized by the MIT Lincoln Lab and associated with the AAAI-19 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS'2019), we propose six guiding principles to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks. Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but the others are introduced in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these six principles, we propose a defense framework to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. By conducting experiments with the Drebin Android malware dataset, we show that the framework can achieve a 98.49\% accuracy (on average) against grey-box attacks, where the attacker knows some information about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack, and an 89.14% accuracy (on average) against the more capable white-box attacks, where the attacker knows everything about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack. The framework wins the AICS'2019 challenge by achieving a 76.02% accuracy, where neither the attacker (i.e., the challenge organizer) knows the framework or defense nor we (the defender) know the attacks. This gap highlights the importance of knowing about the attack.

<summary>2021-01-15 17:34:40 - Towards interpreting ML-based automated malware detection models: a survey</summary>

- *Yuzhou Lin, Xiaolin Chang*

> Malware is being increasingly threatening and malware detectors based on traditional signature-based analysis are no longer suitable for current malware detection. Recently, the models based on machine learning (ML) are developed for predicting unknown malware variants and saving human strength. However, most of the existing ML models are black-box, which made their pre-diction results undependable, and therefore need further interpretation in order to be effectively deployed in the wild. This paper aims to examine and categorize the existing researches on ML-based malware detector interpretability. We first give a detailed comparison over the previous work on common ML model inter-pretability in groups after introducing the principles, attributes, evaluation indi-cators and taxonomy of common ML interpretability. Then we investigate the interpretation methods towards malware detection, by addressing the importance of interpreting malware detectors, challenges faced by this field, solutions for migitating these challenges, and a new taxonomy for classifying all the state-of-the-art malware detection interpretability work in recent years. The highlight of our survey is providing a new taxonomy towards malware detection interpreta-tion methods based on the common taxonomy summarized by previous re-searches in the common field. In addition, we are the first to evaluate the state-of-the-art approaches by interpretation method attributes to generate the final score so as to give insight to quantifying the interpretability. By concluding the results of the recent researches, we hope our work can provide suggestions for researchers who are interested in the interpretability on ML-based malware de-tection models.

> Recent technological advancements have proliferated the use of small embedded devices for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical information. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled remote access and control of these network-connected devices. Consequently, an attacker can exploit security vulnerabilities and compromise these devices. In this context, the secure boot becomes a useful security mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software state of the devices. However, the current secure boot schemes focus on detecting the presence of potential malware on the device but not on disinfecting and restoring the soft-ware to a benign state. This manuscript presents CARE- the first secure boot framework that provides detection, resilience, and onboard recovery mechanism for the com-promised devices. The framework uses a prototype hybrid CARE: Code Authentication and Resilience Engine to verify the software state and restore it to a benign state. It uses Physical Memory Protection (PMP) and other security enchaining techniques of RISC-V processor to pro-vide resilience from modern attacks. The state-of-the-art comparison and performance analysis results indicate that the proposed secure boot framework provides a promising resilience and recovery mechanism with very little 8 % performance and resource overhead

> Attributing a piece of malware to its creator typically requires threat intelligence. Binary attribution increases the level of difficulty as it mostly relies upon the ability to disassemble binaries to identify authorship style. Our survey explores malicious author style and the adversarial techniques used by them to remain anonymous. We examine the adversarial impact on the state-of-the-art methods. We identify key findings and explore the open research challenges. To mitigate the lack of ground truth datasets in this domain, we publish alongside this survey the largest and most diverse meta-information dataset of 15,660 malware labeled to 164 threat actor groups.

> Most of today's security solutions, such as security information and event management (SIEM) and signature based IDS, require the operator to evaluate potential attack vectors and update detection signatures and rules in a timely manner. However, today's sophisticated and tailored advanced persistent threats (APT), malware, ransomware and rootkits, can be so complex and diverse, and often use zero day exploits, that a pure signature-based blacklisting approach would not be sufficient to detect them. Therefore, we could observe a major paradigm shift towards anomaly-based detection mechanisms, which try to establish a system behavior baseline -- either based on netflow data or system logging data -- and report any deviations from this baseline. While these approaches look promising, they usually suffer from scalability issues. As the amount of log data generated during IT operations is exponentially growing, high-performance analysis methods are required that can handle this huge amount of data in real-time. In this paper, we demonstrate how high-performance bioinformatics tools can be applied to tackle this issue. We investigate their application to log data for outlier detection to timely reveal anomalous system behavior that points to cyber attacks. Finally, we assess the detection capability and run-time performance of the proposed approach.

> There is a growing body of malware samples that evade automated analysis and detection tools. Malware may measure fingerprints ("artifacts") of the underlying analysis tool or environment and change their behavior when artifacts are detected. While analysis tools can mitigate artifacts to reduce exposure, such concealment is expensive. However, not every sample checks for every type of artifact-analysis efficiency can be improved by mitigating only those artifacts most likely to be used by a sample. Using that insight, we propose MIMOSA, a system that identifies a small set of "covering" tool configurations that collectively defeat most malware samples with increased efficiency. MIMOSA identifies a set of tool configurations that maximize analysis throughput and detection accuracy while minimizing manual effort, enabling scalable automation to analyze stealthy malware. We evaluate our approach against a benchmark of 1535 labeled stealthy malware samples. Our approach increases analysis throughput over state of the art on over 95% of these samples. We also investigate cost-benefit tradeoffs between the fraction of successfully-analyzed samples and computing resources required. MIMOSA provides a practical, tunable method for efficiently deploying analysis resources.

> In this paper, we present MORTON, a method that identifies compromised devices in enterprise networks based on the existence of routine DNS communication between devices and disreputable host names. With its compact representation of the input data and use of efficient signal processing and a neural network for classification, MORTON is designed to be accurate, robust, and scalable. We evaluate MORTON using a large dataset of corporate DNS logs and compare it with two recently proposed beaconing detection methods aimed at detecting malware communication. The results demonstrate that while MORTON's accuracy in a synthetic experiment is comparable to that of the other methods, it outperforms those methods in terms of its ability to detect sophisticated bot communication techniques, such as multistage channels, as well as in its robustness and efficiency. In a real-world evaluation, which includes previously unreported threats, MORTON and the two compared methods were deployed to monitor the (unlabeled) DNS traffic of two global enterprises for a week-long period; this evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MORTON in real-world scenarios and showcases its superiority in terms of true and false positive rates.

> Nowadays, malware campaigns have reached a high level of sophistication, thanks to the use of cryptography and covert communication channels over traditional protocols and services. In this regard, a typical approach to evade botnet identification and takedown mechanisms is the use of domain fluxing through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms produce an overwhelming amount of domain names that the infected device tries to communicate with to find the Command and Control server, yet only a small fragment of them is actually registered. Due to the high number of domain names, the blacklisting approach is rendered useless. Therefore, the botmaster may pivot the control dynamically and hinder botnet detection mechanisms. To counter this problem, many security mechanisms result in solutions that try to identify domains from a DGA based on the randomness of their name.   In this work, we explore hard to detect families of DGAs, as they are constructed to bypass these mechanisms. More precisely, they are based on the use of dictionaries so the domains seem to be user-generated. Therefore, the corresponding generated domains pass many filters that look for, e.g. high entropy strings. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and efficient probabilistic approach to detect them. We test and validate the proposed solution through extensive experiments with a sound dataset containing all the wordlist-based DGA families that exhibit this behaviour and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods, practically showing the efficacy and prevalence of our proposal.

> We propose a novel method to detect and visualize malware through image classification. The executable binaries are represented as grayscale images obtained from the count of N-grams (N=2) of bytes in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and a neural network is trained for malware detection. A shallow neural network is trained for classification, and its accuracy is compared with deep-network architectures such as ResNet that are trained using transfer learning. Neither dis-assembly nor behavioral analysis of malware is required for these methods. Motivated by the visual similarity of these images for different malware families, we compare our deep neural network models with standard image features like GIST descriptors to evaluate the performance. A joint feature measure is proposed to combine different features using error analysis to get an accurate ensemble model for improved classification performance. A new dataset called MaleX which contains around 1 million malware and benign Windows executable samples is created for large-scale malware detection and classification experiments. Experimental results are quite promising with 96% binary classification accuracy on MaleX. The proposed model is also able to generalize well on larger unseen malware samples and the results compare favorably with state-of-the-art static analysis-based malware detection algorithms.

> The current state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems are based on machine learning and deep learning models. Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against adversarial attacks. For this purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in the adversary's shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximizing fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app's functionality and behavior do not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21% and 53.20% across all the eight detection models with a maximum of five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate of 86.09% with five changes was attained against the decision tree-based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defense strategy that reduces the average fooling rate by threefold to 15.22% against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.

> Machine learning for malware classification shows encouraging results, but real deployments suffer from performance degradation as malware authors adapt their techniques to evade detection. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, occurs as new malware examples evolve and become less and less like the original training examples. One promising method to cope with concept drift is classification with rejection in which examples that are likely to be misclassified are instead quarantined until they can be expertly analyzed. We propose TRANSCENDENT, a rejection framework built on Transcend, a recently proposed strategy based on conformal prediction theory. In particular, we provide a formal treatment of Transcend, enabling us to refine conformal evaluation theory -- its underlying statistical engine -- and gain a better understanding of the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness. In the process, we develop two additional conformal evaluators that match or surpass the performance of the original while significantly decreasing the computational overhead. We evaluate TRANSCENDENT on a malware dataset spanning 5 years that removes sources of experimental bias present in the original evaluation. To further assist practitioners, we determine the optimal operational settings for a TRANSCENDENT deployment and show how it can be applied to many popular learning algorithms. These insights support both old and new empirical findings, making Transcend a sound and practical solution for the first time. To this end, we release TRANSCENDENT as open source, to aid the adoption of rejection strategies by the security community.

> Android is currently the most extensively used smartphone platform in the world. Due to its popularity and open source nature, Android malware has been rapidly growing in recent years, and bringing great risks to users' privacy. The malware applications in a malware family may have common features and similar behaviors, which are beneficial for malware detection and inspection. Thus, classifying Android malware into their corresponding families is an important task in malware analysis. At present, the main problem of existing research works on Android malware family classification lies in that the extracted features are inadequate to represent the common behavior characteristics of the malware in malicious families, and leveraging a single classifier or a static ensemble classifier is restricted to further improve the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we propose FamDroid, a learning-based Android malware family classification scheme using static analysis technology. In FamDroid, the explicit features including permissions, hardware components, app components, intent filters are extracted from the apk files of a malware application. Besides, a hidden feature generated from the extracted APIs is used to represents the API call relationship in the application. Then, we design an adaptive weighted ensemble classifier, which considers the adaptability of the sample to each base classifier, to carry out accurate malware family classification. We conducted experiments on the Drebin dataset which contains 5560 Android malicious applications. The superiority of FamDroid is demonstrated through comparing it with 5 traditional machine learning models and 4 state-of-the-art reference schemes. FamDroid can correctly classify 98.92% of malware samples into their families and achieve 99.12% F1-Score.

> Ransomware is a growing threat that typically operates by either encrypting a victim's files or locking a victim's computer until the victim pays a ransom. However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called "Peeler" (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware's inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system's kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99\% detection rate with 0.58\% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9\% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.

> Computer vision is playing an increasingly important role in automated malware detection with to the rise of the image-based binary representation. These binary images are fast to generate, require no feature engineering, and are resilient to popular obfuscation methods. Significant research has been conducted in this area, however, it has been restricted to small-scale or private datasets that only a few industry labs and research teams have access to. This lack of availability hinders examination of existing work, development of new research, and dissemination of ideas. We introduce MalNet, the largest publicly available cybersecurity image database, offering 133x more images and 27x more classes than the only other public binary-image database. MalNet contains over 1.2 million images across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families. We provide extensive analysis of MalNet, discussing its properties and provenance. The scale and diversity of MalNet unlocks new and exciting cybersecurity opportunities to the computer vision community--enabling discoveries and research directions that were previously not possible. The database is publicly available at www.mal-net.org.

- `2102.00898v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00898v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00898v1)

> In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to normalize metamorphic and obfuscated malware down at the opcode level and hence create an advanced metamorphic malware de-obfuscation and defense system. We name this system DRLDO, for Deep Reinforcement Learning based De-Obfuscator. With the inclusion of the DRLDO as a sub-component, an existing Intrusion Detection System could be augmented with defensive capabilities against 'zero-day' attacks from obfuscated and metamorphic variants of existing malware. This gains importance, not only because there exists no system to date that uses advanced DRL to intelligently and automatically normalize obfuscation down even to the opcode level, but also because the DRLDO system does not mandate any changes to the existing IDS. The DRLDO system does not even mandate the IDS' classifier to be retrained with any new dataset containing obfuscated samples. Hence DRLDO could be easily retrofitted into any existing IDS deployment. We designed, developed, and conducted experiments on the system to evaluate the same against multiple-simultaneous attacks from obfuscations generated from malware samples from a standardized dataset that contains multiple generations of malware. Experimental results prove that DRLDO was able to successfully make the otherwise un-detectable obfuscated variants of the malware detectable by an existing pre-trained malware classifier. The detection probability was raised well above the cut-off mark to 0.6 for the classifier to detect the obfuscated malware unambiguously. Further, the de-obfuscated variants generated by DRLDO achieved a very high correlation (of 0.99) with the base malware. This observation validates that the DRLDO system is actually learning to de-obfuscate and not exploiting a trivial trick.

> Many techniques have been proposed for quickly detecting and containing malware-generated network attacks such as large-scale denial of service attacks; unfortunately, much damage is already done within the first few minutes of an attack, before it is identified and contained. There is a need for an early warning system that can predict attacks before they actually manifest, so that upcoming attacks can be prevented altogether by blocking the hosts that are likely to engage in attacks. However, blocking responses may disrupt legitimate processes on blocked hosts; in order to minimise user inconvenience, it is important to also foretell the time when the predicted attacks will occur, so that only the most urgent threats result in auto-blocking responses, while less urgent ones are first manually investigated. To this end, we identify a typical infection sequence followed by modern malware; modelling this sequence as a Markov chain and training it on real malicious traffic, we are able to identify behaviour most likely to lead to attacks and predict 98\% of real-world spamming and port-scanning attacks before they occur. Moreover, using a Semi-Markov chain model, we are able to foretell the time of upcoming attacks, a novel capability that allows accurately predicting the times of 97% of real-world malware attacks. Our work represents an important and timely step towards enabling flexible threat response models that minimise disruption to legitimate users.

- `2008.00123v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00123v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00123v2)

> The ubiquity of deep neural networks (DNNs), cloud-based training, and transfer learning is giving rise to a new cybersecurity frontier in which unsecure DNNs have `structural malware' (i.e., compromised weights and activation pathways). In particular, DNNs can be designed to have backdoors that allow an adversary to easily and reliably fool an image classifier by adding a pattern of pixels called a trigger. It is generally difficult to detect backdoors, and existing detection methods are computationally expensive and require extensive resources (e.g., access to the training data). Here, we propose a rapid feature-generation technique that quantifies the robustness of a DNN, `fingerprints' its nonlinearity, and allows us to detect backdoors (if present). Our approach involves studying how a DNN responds to noise-infused images with varying noise intensity, which we summarize with titration curves. We find that DNNs with backdoors are more sensitive to input noise and respond in a characteristic way that reveals the backdoor and where it leads (its `target'). Our empirical results demonstrate that we can accurately detect backdoors with high confidence orders-of-magnitude faster than existing approaches (seconds versus hours).

> In recent years, malware becomes more threatening. Concerning the increasing malware variants, there comes Machine Learning (ML)-based and Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches for heuristic detection. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy of both needs to be improved. In response to the above issues in the PE malware domain, we propose the DL-based approaches for detection and use static-based features fed up into models. The contributions are as follows: we recapitulate existing malware detection methods. That is, we propose a vec-torized representation model of the malware instruction layer and semantic layer based on Glove. We implement a neural network model called MCC_RCNN (Malware Detection and Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network), comprising of the combination with CNN and RNN. Moreover, we provide a description of feature fusion in static behavior levels. With the numerical results generated from several comparative experiments towards evaluating the Glove-based vectoriza-tion, MCC_RCNN-based classification methodology and feature fusion stages, our proposed classification methods can obtain a higher prediction accuracy than the other baseline methods.

> In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to an assembly function a string of words that would likely be assigned by a human reverse engineer. We formally and precisely define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define the problem, we provide reasonable justifications for the choices that we made for the design of training and the tests. We performed an analysis on a large real-world corpora constituted by nearly 9 millions of functions taken from more than 22k softwares. In such framework we test baselines coming from the field of Natural Language Processing (e.g., Seq2Seq networks and Transformer). Interestingly, our evaluation shows promising results beating the state-of-the-art and reaching good performance. We investigate the applicability of tine-tuning (i.e., taking a model already trained on a large generic corpora and retraining it for a specific task). Such technique is popular and well-known in the NLP field. Our results confirm that fine-tuning is effective even when neural networks are applied to binaries. We show that a model, pre-trained on the aforementioned corpora, when fine-tuned has higher performances on specific domains (such as predicting names in system utilites, malware, etc).

> Malware analysis has been extensively investigated as the number and types of malware has increased dramatically. However, most previous studies use end-to-end systems to detect whether a sample is malicious, or to identify its malware family. In this paper, we propose a neural network framework composed of an embedder, an encoder, and a filter to learn malware representations from characteristic execution sequences for malware family classification. The embedder uses BERT and Sent2Vec, state-of-the-art embedding modules, to capture relations within a single API call and among consecutive API calls in an execution trace. The encoder comprises gated recurrent units (GRU) to preserve the ordinal position of API calls and a self-attention mechanism for comparing intra-relations among different positions of API calls. The filter identifies representative API calls to build the malware representation. We conduct broad experiments to determine the influence of individual framework components. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines, and also demonstrates that considering Sent2Vec to learn complete API call embeddings and GRU to explicitly preserve ordinal information yields more information and thus significant improvements. Also, the proposed approach effectively classifies new malicious execution traces on the basis of similarities with previously collected families.

> Numerous recent studies have demonstrated how Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by adversarial examples, in which an attacker adds perturbations to an original sample, causing the classifier to misclassify the sample. Adversarial attacks that render DNNs vulnerable in real life represent a serious threat in autonomous vehicles, malware filters, or biometric authentication systems. In this paper, we apply Fast Gradient Sign Method to introduce perturbations to a facial image dataset and then test the output on a different classifier that we trained ourselves, to analyze transferability of this method. Next, we craft a variety of different black-box attack algorithms on a facial image dataset assuming minimal adversarial knowledge, to further assess the robustness of DNNs in facial recognition. While experimenting with different image distortion techniques, we focus on modifying single optimal pixels by a large amount, or modifying all pixels by a smaller amount, or combining these two attack approaches. While our single-pixel attacks achieved about a 15% average decrease in classifier confidence level for the actual class, the all-pixel attacks were more successful and achieved up to an 84% average decrease in confidence, along with an 81.6% misclassification rate, in the case of the attack that we tested with the highest levels of perturbation. Even with these high levels of perturbation, the face images remained identifiable to a human. Understanding how these noised and perturbed images baffle the classification algorithms can yield valuable advances in the training of DNNs against defense-aware adversarial attacks, as well as adaptive noise reduction techniques. We hope our research may help to advance the study of adversarial attacks on DNNs and defensive mechanisms to counteract them, particularly in the facial recognition domain.

> The commoditization of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows criminals to obtain financial benefits at a low risk and with little technical background. One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.   In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of Avaddon, a ransomware offered in the underground economy as an affiliate program business. This has infected and leaked data from at least 23 organizations. Additionally, it runs Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against victims that do not pay the ransom. We first provide an analysis of the criminal business model from the underground economy. Then, we identify and describe its technical capabilities. We provide empirical evidence of links between this variant and a previous family, suggesting that the same group was behind the development and, possibly, the operation of both campaigns.   Finally, we describe a method to decrypt files encrypted with Avaddon in real time. We implement and test the decryptor in a tool that can recover the encrypted data from an infected system, thus mitigating the damage caused by the ransomware. The tool is released open-source so it can be incorporated in existing Antivirus engines.

> Cyber threat and attack intelligence information are available in non-standard format from heterogeneous sources. Comprehending them and utilizing them for threat intelligence extraction requires engaging security experts. Knowledge graphs enable converting this unstructured information from heterogeneous sources into a structured representation of data and factual knowledge for several downstream tasks such as predicting missing information and future threat trends. Existing large-scale knowledge graphs mainly focus on general classes of entities and relationships between them. Open-source knowledge graphs for the security domain do not exist.

> In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.

> Smartphones contain information that is more sensitive and personal than those found on computers and laptops. With an increase in the versatility of smartphone functionality, more data has become vulnerable and exposed to attackers. Successful mobile malware attacks could steal a user's location, photos, or even banking information. Due to a lack of post-attack strategies firms also risk going out of business due to data theft. Thus, there is a need besides just detecting malware intrusion in smartphones but to also identify the data that has been stolen to assess, aid in recovery and prevent future attacks. In this paper, we propose an accessible, non-intrusive machine learning solution to not only detect malware intrusion but also identify the type of data stolen for any app under supervision. We do this with Android usage data obtained by utilising publicly available data collection framework- SherLock. We test the performance of our architecture for multiple users on real-world data collected using the same framework. Our architecture exhibits less than 9% inaccuracy in detecting malware and can classify with 83% certainty on the type of data that is being stolen.

> Machine learning classification models are vulnerable to adversarial examples -- effective input-specific perturbations that can manipulate the model's output. Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which identify noisy patterns that generalize across the input space, allow the attacker to greatly scale up the generation of these adversarial examples. Although UAPs have been explored in application domains beyond computer vision, little is known about their properties and implications in the specific context of realizable attacks, such as malware, where attackers must reason about satisfying challenging problem-space constraints.   In this paper, we explore the challenges and strengths of UAPs in the context of malware classification. We generate sequences of problem-space transformations that induce UAPs in the corresponding feature-space embedding and evaluate their effectiveness across threat models that consider a varying degree of realistic attacker knowledge. Additionally, we propose adversarial training-based mitigations using knowledge derived from the problem-space transformations, and compare against alternative feature-space defenses. Our experiments limit the effectiveness of a white box Android evasion attack to ~20 % at the cost of 3 % TPR at 1 % FPR. We additionally show how our method can be adapted to more restrictive application domains such as Windows malware.   We observe that while adversarial training in the feature space must deal with large and often unconstrained regions, UAPs in the problem space identify specific vulnerabilities that allow us to harden a classifier more effectively, shifting the challenges and associated cost of identifying new universal adversarial transformations back to the attacker.

> As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.

> Attackers are perpetually modifying their tactics to avoid detection and frequently leverage legitimate credentials with trusted tools already deployed in a network environment, making it difficult for organizations to proactively identify critical security risks. Network traffic analysis products have emerged in response to attackers relentless innovation, offering organizations a realistic path forward for combatting creative attackers. Additionally, thanks to the widespread adoption of cloud computing, Device Operators processes, and the Internet of Things, maintaining effective network visibility has become a highly complex and overwhelming process. What makes network traffic analysis technology particularly meaningful is its ability to combine its core capabilities to deliver malicious intent detection. In this paper, we propose a novel darknet traffic analysis and network management framework to real-time automating the malicious intent detection process, using a weight agnostic neural networks architecture. It is an effective and accurate computational intelligent forensics tool for network traffic analysis, the demystification of malware traffic, and encrypted traffic identification in real-time. Based on Weight Agnostic Neural Networks methodology, we propose an automated searching neural net architectures strategy that can perform various tasks such as identify zero-day attacks. By automating the malicious intent detection process from the darknet, the advanced proposed solution is reducing the skills and effort barrier that prevents many organizations from effectively protecting their most critical assets.

> Large amounts of threat intelligence information about mal-ware attacks are available in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can capture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by entities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads to challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully guaran-tee accurate information retrieval, further exacerbating this problem. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach to generate a Malware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge graph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset called MT40K1 contains approximately 40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. We demonstrate the application of MalKGin predicting missing malware threat intelligence information in the knowledge graph. For ground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027 triples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. For entity prediction via a state-of-the-art entity prediction model(TuckER), our approach achieves 80.4 for the hits@10 metric (predicts the top 10 options for missing entities in the knowledge graph), and 0.75 for the MRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose a framework to automate the extraction of thousands of entities and relations into RDF triples, both manually and automatically, at the sentence level from1,100 malware threat intelligence reports and from the com-mon vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) database.

- `2003.13526v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13526v4)

> Windows malware detectors based on machine learning are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even if the attacker is only given black-box query access to the model. The main drawback of these attacks is that: (i) they are query-inefficient, as they rely on iteratively applying random transformations to the input malware; and (ii) they may also require executing the adversarial malware in a sandbox at each iteration of the optimization process, to ensure that its intrusive functionality is preserved. In this paper, we overcome these issues by presenting a novel family of black-box attacks that are both query-efficient and functionality-preserving, as they rely on the injection of benign content - which will never be executed - either at the end of the malicious file, or within some newly-created sections. Our attacks are formalized as a constrained minimization problem which also enables optimizing the trade-off between the probability of evading detection and the size of the injected payload. We empirically investigate this trade-off on two popular static Windows malware detectors, and show that our black-box attacks can bypass them with only few queries and small payloads, even when they only return the predicted labels. We also evaluate whether our attacks transfer to other commercial antivirus solutions, and surprisingly find that they can evade, on average, more than 12 commercial antivirus engines. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our approach, and its possible future extensions to target malware classifiers based on dynamic analysis.

> Ransomware has emerged as an infamous malware that has not escaped a lot of myths and inaccuracies from media hype. Victims are not sure whether or not to pay a ransom demand without fully understanding the lurking consequences. In this paper, we present a ransomware classification framework based on file-deletion and file-encryption attack structures that provides a deeper comprehension of potential flaws and inadequacies exhibited in ransomware. We formulate a threat and attack model representative of a typical ransomware attack process from which we derive the ransomware categorization framework based on a proposed classification algorithm. The framework classifies the virulence of a ransomware attack to entail the overall effectiveness of potential ways of recovering the attacked data without paying the ransom demand as well as the technical prowess of the underlying attack structures. Results of the categorization, in increasing severity from CAT1 through to CAT5, show that many ransomwares exhibit flaws in their implementation of encryption and deletion attack structures which make data recovery possible without paying the ransom. The most severe categories CAT4 and CAT5 are better mitigated by exploiting encryption essentials while CAT3 can be effectively mitigated via reverse engineering. CAT1 and CAT2 are not common and are easily mitigated without any decryption essentials.

> The development of machine learning algorithms in the cyber security domain has been impeded by the complex, hierarchical, sequential and multimodal nature of the data involved. In this paper we introduce the notion of a streaming tree as a generic data structure encompassing a large portion of real-world cyber security data. Starting from host-based event logs we represent computer processes as streaming trees that evolve in continuous time. Leveraging the properties of the signature kernel, a machine learning tool that recently emerged as a leading technology for learning with complex sequences of data, we develop the SK-Tree algorithm. SK-Tree is a supervised learning method for systematic malware detection on streaming trees that is robust to irregular sampling and high dimensionality of the underlying streams. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SK-Tree to detect malicious events on a portion of the publicly available DARPA OpTC dataset, achieving an AUROC score of 98%.

This paper seeks to provide a dedicated review of the very recent research works on using Deep Learning techniques to solve computer security challenges. In particular, the review covers eight computer security problems being solved by applications of Deep Learning: security-oriented program analysis, defending return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks, achieving control-flow integrity (CFI), defending network attacks, malware classification, system-event-based anomaly detection, memory forensics, and fuzzing for software security.

> Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. Although such approaches are valid for images, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic adversarial examples in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Our approach can be adapted to other domains where non-uniform perturbations more accurately represent realistic adversarial examples.

> In recent years the PC has been replaced by mobile devices for many security sensitive operations, both from a privacy and a financial standpoint. While security mechanisms are deployed at various levels, these are frequently put under strain by previously unseen malware. An additional protection layer capable of novelty detection is therefore needed. In this work we propose SpotCheck, an anomaly detector intended to run on Android devices. It samples app executions and submits suspicious apps to more thorough processing by malware sandboxes. We compare Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) on app execution representations based on the well-known system call traces, as well as a novel approach based on memory dumps. Results show that when using VAE, SpotCheck attains a level of effectiveness comparable to what has been previously achieved for network anomaly detection. Interestingly this is also true for the memory dump approach, relinquishing the need for continuous app monitoring.

> New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) has been revolutionizing this world by introducing exciting applications almost in all walks of daily life, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart environments, safety, remote sensing, and many more. This paper proposes a new framework based on the blockchain and deep learning model to provide more security for Android IoT devices. Moreover, our framework is capable to find the malware activities in a real-time environment. The proposed deep learning model analyzes various static and dynamic features extracted from thousands of feature of malware and benign apps that are already stored in blockchain distributed ledger. The multi-layer deep learning model makes decisions by analyzing the previous data and follow some steps. Firstly, it divides the malware feature into multiple level clusters. Secondly, it chooses a unique deep learning model for each malware feature set or cluster. Finally, it produces the decision by combining the results generated from all cluster levels. Furthermore, the decisions and multiple-level clustering data are stored in a blockchain that can be further used to train every specialized cluster for unique data distribution. Also, a customized smart contract is designed to detect deceptive applications through the blockchain framework. The smart contract verifies the malicious application both during the uploading and downloading process of Android apps on the network. Consequently, the proposed framework provides flexibility to features for run-time security regarding malware detection on heterogeneous IoT devices. Finally, the smart contract helps to approve or deny to uploading and downloading harmful Android applications.

> The short note presents an image classification dataset consisting of 10 executable code varieties and approximately 50,000 virus examples. The malicious classes include 9 families of computer viruses and one benign set. The image formatting for the first 1024 bytes of the Portable Executable (PE) mirrors the familiar MNIST handwriting dataset, such that most of the previously explored algorithmic methods can transfer with minor modifications. The designation of 9 virus families for malware derives from unsupervised learning of class labels; we discover the families with KMeans clustering that excludes the non-malicious examples. As a benchmark using deep learning methods (MobileNetV2), we find an overall 80% accuracy for virus identification by families when beneware is included. We also find that once a positive malware detection occurs (by signature or heuristics), the projection of the first 1024 bytes into a thumbnail image can classify with 87% accuracy the type of virus. The work generalizes what other malware investigators have demonstrated as promising convolutional neural networks originally developed to solve image problems but applied to a new abstract domain in pixel bytes from executable files. The dataset is available on Kaggle and Github.

> Today anti-malware community is facing challenges due to the ever-increasing sophistication and volume of malware attacks developed by adversaries. Traditional malware detection mechanisms are not able to cope-up with next-generation malware attacks. Therefore in this paper, we propose effective and efficient Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep learning integrated with clustering. We performed a comprehensive study of different feature reduction, classification and clustering algorithms over various performance metrics to construct the Android malware detection models. Our experimental results show that malware detection models developed using Random Forest eclipsed deep neural network and other classifiers on the majority of performance metrics. The baseline Random Forest model without any feature reduction achieved the highest AUC of 99.4%. Also, the segregating of vector space using clustering integrated with Random Forest further boosted the AUC to 99.6% in one cluster and direct detection of Android malware in another cluster, thus reducing the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we found that feature reduction in detection models does improve the model efficiency (training and testing time) many folds without much penalty on the effectiveness of the detection model.

> Since Google unveiled Android OS for smartphones, malware are thriving with 3Vs, i.e. volume, velocity, and variety. A recent report indicates that one out of every five business/industry mobile application leaks sensitive personal data. Traditional signature/heuristic-based malware detection systems are unable to cope up with current malware challenges and thus threaten the Android ecosystem. Therefore recently researchers have started exploring machine learning and deep learning based malware detection systems. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive feature analysis to identify the significant Android permissions and propose an efficient Android malware detection system using machine learning and deep neural network. We constructed a set of $16$ permissions ($8\%$ of the total set) derived from variance threshold, auto-encoders, and principal component analysis to build a malware detection engine that consumes less train and test time without significant compromise on the model accuracy. Our experimental results show that the Android malware detection model based on the random forest classifier is most balanced and achieves the highest area under curve score of $97.7\%$, which is better than the current state-of-art systems. We also observed that deep neural networks attain comparable accuracy to the baseline results but with a massive computational penalty.

We then design, implement, formally verify, and evaluate GAROTA: Generalized Active Root-Of-Trust Architecture. We believe that GAROTA is the first clean-slate design of an active RoT for low-end MCU-s. We show how GAROTA guarantees that even a fully software-compromised low-end MCU performs a desired action. We demonstrate its practicality by implementing GAROTA in the context of three types of applications where actions are triggered by: sensing hardware, network events and timers. We also formally specify and verify GAROTA functionality and properties.

> Malware classification is an important and challenging problem in information security. Modern malware classification techniques rely on machine learning models that can be trained on features such as opcode sequences, API calls, and byte $n$-grams, among many others. In this research, we consider opcode features. We implement hybrid machine learning techniques, where we engineer feature vectors by training hidden Markov models -- a technique that we refer to as HMM2Vec -- and Word2Vec embeddings on these opcode sequences. The resulting HMM2Vec and Word2Vec embedding vectors are then used as features for classification algorithms. Specifically, we consider support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. We conduct substantial experiments over a variety of malware families. Our experiments extend well beyond any previous work in this field.

> Signature and anomaly based techniques are the quintessential approaches to malware detection. However, these techniques have become increasingly ineffective as malware has become more sophisticated and complex. Researchers have therefore turned to deep learning to construct better performing model. In this paper, we create four different long-short term memory (LSTM) based models and train each to classify malware samples from 20 families. Our features consist of opcodes extracted from malware executables. We employ techniques used in natural language processing (NLP), including word embedding and bidirection LSTMs (biLSTM), and we also use convolutional neural networks (CNN). We find that a model consisting of word embedding, biLSTMs, and CNN layers performs best in our malware classification experiments.

However, the continuous analog of discrete HMMs, that is, Gaussian mixture model-HMMs (GMM-HMM), are rarely considered in the field of cybersecurity. In this paper, we use GMM-HMMs for malware classification and we compare our results to those obtained using discrete HMMs. As features, we consider opcode sequences and entropy-based sequences. For our opcode features, GMM-HMMs produce results that are comparable to those obtained using discrete HMMs, whereas for our entropy-based features, GMM-HMMs generally improve significantly on the classification results that we have achieved with discrete HMMs.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Transformers' architecture to automatically detect malicious software. We propose a model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which performs a static analysis on the source code of Android applications using preprocessed features to characterize existing malware and classify it into different representative malware categories. The obtained results are promising and show the high performance obtained by Transformer-based models for malicious software detection.

> Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through \textit{cryptojacking} malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features.

> Word embeddings are often used in natural language processing as a means to quantify relationships between words. More generally, these same word embedding techniques can be used to quantify relationships between features. In this paper, we first consider multiple different word embedding techniques within the context of malware classification. We use hidden Markov models to obtain embedding vectors in an approach that we refer to as HMM2Vec, and we generate vector embeddings based on principal component analysis. We also consider the popular neural network based word embedding technique known as Word2Vec. In each case, we derive feature embeddings based on opcode sequences for malware samples from a variety of different families. We show that we can obtain better classification accuracy based on these feature embeddings, as compared to HMM experiments that directly use the opcode sequences, and serve to establish a baseline. These results show that word embeddings can be a useful feature engineering step in the field of malware analysis.

From this general introduction, we then pivot to the topic of ensemble learning within the context of malware analysis. We present a brief survey of some of the ensemble techniques that have been used in malware (and related) research. We conclude with an extensive set of experiments, where we apply ensemble techniques to a large and challenging malware dataset. While many of these ensemble techniques have appeared in the malware literature, previously there has been no way to directly compare results such as these, as different datasets and different measures of success are typically used. Our common framework and empirical results are an effort to bring some sense of order to the chaos that is evident in the evolving field of ensemble learning -- both within the narrow confines of the malware analysis problem, and in the larger realm of machine learning in general.

> Malware detection is a critical aspect of information security. One difficulty that arises is that malware often evolves over time. To maintain effective malware detection, it is necessary to determine when malware evolution has occurred so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. We perform a variety of experiments aimed at detecting points in time where a malware family has likely evolved, and we consider secondary tests designed to confirm that evolution has actually occurred. Several malware families are analyzed, each of which includes a number of samples collected over an extended period of time. Our experiments indicate that improved results are obtained using feature engineering based on word embedding techniques. All of our experiments are based on machine learning models, and hence our evolution detection strategies require minimal human intervention and can easily be automated.

However, with the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, android malware defenses based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective due to limited apriori knowledge. In recent years, a dominant research field of deep learning (DL) with the powerful feature abstraction ability has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in various fields, like Nature Language processing and image processing. To this end, employing deep learning techniques to thwart the attack of Android malware has recently gained considerable research attention. Yet, there exists no systematic literature review that focuses on deep learning approaches for Android Malware defenses. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 104 studies were identified over the period 2014-2020. The results of our investigation show that even though most of these studies still mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 35 primary studies (33.7\%) design the defenses approaches based on other scenarios. This review also describes research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.

> Security is critical to the adoption of open source software (OSS), yet few automated solutions currently exist to help detect and prevent malicious contributions from infecting open source repositories. On GitHub, a primary host of OSS, repositories contain not only code but also a wealth of commit-related and contextual metadata - what if this metadata could be used to automatically identify malicious OSS contributions? In this work, we show how to use only commit logs and repository metadata to automatically detect anomalous and potentially malicious commits. We identify and evaluate several relevant factors which can be automatically computed from this data, such as the modification of sensitive files, outlier change properties, or a lack of trust in the commit's author. Our tool, Anomalicious, automatically computes these factors and considers them holistically using a rule-based decision model. In an evaluation on a data set of 15 malware-infected repositories, Anomalicious showed promising results and identified 53.33% of malicious commits, while flagging less than 1% of commits for most repositories. Additionally, the tool found other interesting anomalies that are not related to malicious commits in an analysis of repositories with no known malicious commits.

> Android's security model severely limits the capabilities of anti-malware software. Unlike commodity anti-malware solutions on desktop systems, their Android counterparts run as sandboxed applications without root privileges and are limited by Android's permission system. As such, PHAs on Android are usually willingly installed by victims, as they come disguised as useful applications with hidden malicious functionality, and are encountered on mobile app stores as suggestions based on the apps that a user previously installed. Users with similar interests and app installation history are likely to be exposed and to decide to install the same PHA. This observation gives us the opportunity to develop predictive approaches that can warn the user about which PHAs they will encounter and potentially be tempted to install in the near future. These approaches could then be used to complement commodity anti-malware solutions, which are focused on post-fact detection, closing the window of opportunity that existing solutions suffer from. In this paper we develop Andruspex, a system based on graph representation learning, allowing us to learn latent relationships between user devices and PHAs and leverage them for prediction. We test Andruspex on a real world dataset of PHA installations collected by a security company, and show that our approach achieves very high prediction results (up to 0.994 TPR at 0.0001 FPR), while at the same time outperforming alternative baseline methods. We also demonstrate that Andruspex is robust and its runtime performance is acceptable for a real world deployment.

> Machine learning-based hardware malware detectors (HMDs) offer a potential game changing advantage in defending systems against malware. However, HMDs suffer from adversarial attacks, can be effectively reverse-engineered and subsequently be evaded, allowing malware to hide from detection. We address this issue by proposing a novel HMDs (Stochastic-HMDs) through approximate computing, which makes HMDs' inference computation-stochastic, thereby making HMDs resilient against adversarial evasion attacks. Specifically, we propose to leverage voltage overscaling to induce stochastic computation in the HMDs model. We show that such a technique makes HMDs more resilient to both black-box adversarial attack scenarios, i.e., reverse-engineering and transferability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic-HMDs offer effective defense against adversarial attacks along with by-product power savings, without requiring any changes to the hardware/software nor to the HMDs' model, i.e., no retraining or fine tuning is needed. Moreover, based on recent results in probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability theory, we show that Stochastic-HMDs are provably more difficult to reverse engineer.

> Malware analysis is still largely a manual task. This slow and inefficient approach does not scale to the exponential rise in the rate of new unique malware generated. Hence, automating the process as much as possible becomes desirable.   In this paper, we present ColdPress - an extensible malware analysis platform that automates the end-to-end process of malware threat intelligence gathering integrated output modules to perform report generation of arbitrary file formats. ColdPress combines state-of-the-art tools and concepts into a modular system that aids the analyst to efficiently and effectively extract information from malware samples. It is designed as a user-friendly and extensible platform that can be easily extended with user-defined modules.   We evaluated ColdPress with complex real-world malware samples (e.g., WannaCry), demonstrating its efficiency, performance and usefulness to security analysts.

> In recent years machine learning algorithms, and more specifically deep learning algorithms, have been widely used in many fields, including cyber security. However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, especially in non-stationary, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain, where actual adversaries (e.g., malware developers) exist. This paper comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker's goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. This paper is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.

> There is a lack of scientific testing of commercially available malware detectors, especially those that boast accurate classification of never-before-seen (i.e., zero-day) files using machine learning (ML). The result is that the efficacy and gaps among the available approaches are opaque, inhibiting end users from making informed network security decisions and researchers from targeting gaps in current detectors. In this paper, we present a scientific evaluation of four market-leading malware detection tools to assist an organization with two primary questions: (Q1) To what extent do ML-based tools accurately classify never-before-seen files without sacrificing detection ability on known files? (Q2) Is it worth purchasing a network-level malware detector to complement host-based detection? We tested each tool against 3,536 total files (2,554 or 72% malicious, 982 or 28% benign) including over 400 zero-day malware, and tested with a variety of file types and protocols for delivery. We present statistical results on detection time and accuracy, consider complementary analysis (using multiple tools together), and provide two novel applications of a recent cost-benefit evaluation procedure by Iannaconne & Bridges that incorporates all the above metrics into a single quantifiable cost. While the ML-based tools are more effective at detecting zero-day files and executables, the signature-based tool may still be an overall better option. Both network-based tools provide substantial (simulated) savings when paired with either host tool, yet both show poor detection rates on protocols other than HTTP or SMTP. Our results show that all four tools have near-perfect precision but alarmingly low recall, especially on file types other than executables and office files -- 37% of malware tested, including all polyglot files, were undetected.

> Machine learning (ML) models that learn and predict properties of computer programs are increasingly being adopted and deployed. These models have demonstrated success in applications such as auto-completing code, summarizing large programs, and detecting bugs and malware in programs. In this work, we investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop first-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects -- which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to ease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the problem of program summarization. We show that our best attack proposal achieves a $52\%$ improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation approach for programs trained on a seq2seq model. We further show that our formulation is better at training models that are robust to adversarial attacks.

> Nowadays ransomware has become a new profitable form of attack. This type of malware acts as a form of extortion which encrypts the files in a victim's computer and forces the victim to pay the ransom to have the data recovered. Even companies and tech savvy people must use extensive resources to maintain backups for recovery or else they will lose valuable data, not mentioning average users. Unfortunately, not any recovery tool can effectively defend various types of ransomware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ransomware defense mechanism that can be easily deployed in modern Windows system to recover the data and mitigate a ransomware attack. The uniqueness of our approach is to fight the virus like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data Streams which are sometimes used by malicious applications, to develop a data protection method that misleads the ransomware to attack only file 'shells' instead of the actual file content. We evaluated different file encrypting ransomware and demonstrate usability, efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

> Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) using Machine Learning (ML) models have shown promise in detecting malicious workloads. However, the conventional black-box based machine learning (ML) approach used in these HMDs fail to address the uncertain predictions, including those made on zero-day malware. The ML models used in HMDs are agnostic to the uncertainty that determines whether the model "knows what it knows," severely undermining its trustworthiness. We propose an ensemble-based approach that quantifies uncertainty in predictions made by ML models of an HMD, when it encounters an unknown workload than the ones it was trained on. We test our approach on two different HMDs that have been proposed in the literature. We show that the proposed uncertainty estimator can detect >90% of unknown workloads for the Power-management based HMD, and conclude that the overlapping benign and malware classes undermine the trustworthiness of the Performance Counter-based HMD.

> Recent work has shown that adversarial Windows malware samples - referred to as adversarial EXEmples in this paper - can bypass machine learning-based detection relying on static code analysis by perturbing relatively few input bytes. To preserve malicious functionality, previous attacks either add bytes to existing non-functional areas of the file, potentially limiting their effectiveness, or require running computationally-demanding validation steps to discard malware variants that do not correctly execute in sandbox environments. In this work, we overcome these limitations by developing a unifying framework that does not only encompass and generalize previous attacks against machine-learning models, but also includes three novel attacks based on practical, functionality-preserving manipulations to the Windows Portable Executable (PE) file format. These attacks, named Full DOS, Extend and Shift, inject the adversarial payload by respectively manipulating the DOS header, extending it, and shifting the content of the first section. Our experimental results show that these attacks outperform existing ones in both white-box and black-box scenarios, achieving a better trade-off in terms of evasion rate and size of the injected payload, while also enabling evasion of models that have been shown to be robust to previous attacks. To facilitate reproducibility of our findings, we open source our framework and all the corresponding attack implementations as part of the secml-malware Python library. We conclude this work by discussing the limitations of current machine learning-based malware detectors, along with potential mitigation strategies based on embedding domain knowledge coming from subject-matter experts directly into the learning process.

> Classifying mobile apps based on their description is beneficial for several purposes. However, many app descriptions do not reflect app functionalities, whether accidentally or on purpose. Most importantly, these app classification methods do not work if the app description is unavailable. This paper investigates a Reverse Engineering-based Approach to Classify mobile apps using The data that exists in the app, called REACT. To validate the proposed REACT method, we use a large set of Android apps (24,652 apps in total). We also show REACTs' extendibility for malware/anomaly detection and prove its reliability and scalability. However, our analysis shows some limitations in REACT procedure and implementation, especially for similar feature based app grouping. We discuss the root cause of these failures, our key lessons learned, and some future enhancement ideas. We also share our REACT tools and reproduced datasets for the app market analyst, mobile app developers and software engineering research communities for further research purposes.

> Research in the field of malware classification often relies on machine learning models that are trained on high-level features, such as opcodes, function calls, and control flow graphs. Extracting such features is costly, since disassembly or code execution is generally required. In this paper, we conduct experiments to train and evaluate machine learning models for malware classification, based on features that can be obtained without disassembly or execution of code. Specifically, we visualize malware samples as images and employ image analysis techniques. In this context, we focus on two machine learning models, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Surprisingly, we find that ELMs can achieve accuracies on par with CNNs, yet ELM training requires less than~2\%\ of the time needed to train a comparable CNN.

Amongst our CNN experiments, transfer learning plays a prominent role specifically, we test the VGG-19 and ResNet152 models. As compared to previous work, the results presented in this paper are based on a larger and more diverse malware dataset, we consider a wider array of features, and we experiment with a much greater variety of learning techniques.

> Since compiler optimization is the most common source contributing to binary code differences in syntax, testing the resilience against the changes caused by different compiler optimization settings has become a standard evaluation step for most binary diffing approaches. For example, 47 top-venue papers in the last 12 years compared different program versions compiled by default optimization levels (e.g., -Ox in GCC and LLVM). Although many of them claim they are immune to compiler transformations, it is yet unclear about their resistance to non-default optimization settings. Especially, we have observed that adversaries explored non-default compiler settings to amplify malware differences.   This paper takes the first step to systematically studying the effectiveness of compiler optimization on binary code differences. We tailor search-based iterative compilation for the auto-tuning of binary code differences. We develop BinTuner to search near-optimal optimization sequences that can maximize the amount of binary code differences. We run BinTuner with GCC 10.2 and LLVM 11.0 on SPEC benchmarks (CPU2006 & CPU2017), Coreutils, and OpenSSL. Our experiments show that at the cost of 279 to 1,881 compilation iterations, BinTuner can find custom optimization sequences that are substantially better than the general -Ox settings. BinTuner's outputs seriously undermine prominent binary diffing tools' comparisons. In addition, the detection rate of the IoT malware variants tuned by BinTuner falls by more than 50%. Our findings paint a cautionary tale for security analysts that attackers have a new way to mutate malware code cost-effectively, and the research community needs to step back to reassess optimization-resistance evaluations.

> The lack of security measures among the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their persistent online connection gives adversaries a prime opportunity to target them or even abuse them as intermediary targets in larger attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns. In this paper, we analyze IoT malware and focus on the endpoints reachable on the public Internet, that play an essential part in the IoT malware ecosystem. Namely, we analyze endpoints acting as dropzones and their targets to gain insights into the underlying dynamics in this ecosystem, such as the affinity between the dropzones and their target IP addresses, and the different patterns among endpoints. Towards this goal, we reverse-engineer 2,423 IoT malware samples and extract strings from them to obtain IP addresses. We further gather information about these endpoints from public Internet-wide scanners, such as Shodan and Censys. For the masked IP addresses, we examine the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) networks accumulating to more than 100 million (78.2% of total active public IPv4 addresses) endpoints. Our investigation from four different perspectives provides profound insights into the role of endpoints in IoT malware attacks, which deepens our understanding of IoT malware ecosystems and can assist future defenses.

> The Linux shell is a command-line interpreter that provides users with a command interface to the operating system, allowing them to perform a variety of functions. Although very useful in building capabilities at the edge, the Linux shell can be exploited, giving adversaries a prime opportunity to use them for malicious activities. With access to IoT devices, malware authors can abuse the Linux shell of those devices to propagate infections and launch large-scale attacks, e.g., DDoS. In this work, we provide a first look at shell commands used in Linux-based IoT malware towards detection. We analyze malicious shell commands found in IoT malware and build a neural network-based model, ShellCore, to detect malicious shell commands. Namely, we collected a large dataset of shell commands, including malicious commands extracted from 2,891 IoT malware samples and benign commands collected from real-world network traffic analysis and volunteered data from Linux users. Using conventional machine and deep learning-based approaches trained with term- and character-level features, ShellCore is shown to achieve an accuracy of more than 99% in detecting malicious shell commands and files (i.e., binaries).

> We offer an embedding of CPython that runs entirely in memory without "touching" the disk. This in-memory embedding can load Python scripts directly from memory instead these scripts having to be loaded from files on disk. Malware that resides only in memory is harder to detect or mitigate against. We intend for our work to be used by security researchers to rapidly develop and deploy offensive techniques that is difficult for security products to analyze given these instructions are in bytecode and only translated to machine-code by the interpreter immediately prior to execution. Our work helps security researchers and enterprise Red Teams who play offense. Red Teams want to rapidly prototype malware for their periodic campaigns and do not want their malware to be detected by the Incident Response (IR) teams prior to accomplishing objectives. Red Teams also have difficulty running malware in production from files on disk as modern enterprise security products emulate, inspect, or quarantine such executables given these files have no reputation. Our work also helps enterprise Hunt and IR teams by making them aware of the viability of this type of attack. Our approach has been in use in production for over a year and meets our customers' needs to quickly emulate threat-actors' tasks, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

> In recent years malware has become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect prior to exploitation. While there are plenty of approaches to malware detection, they all have shortcomings when it comes to identifying malware correctly prior to exploitation. The trade-off is usually between false positives, causing overhead, preventing normal usage and the risk of letting the malware execute and cause damage to the target. We present a novel end-to-end solution for in-memory malicious activity detection done prior to exploitation by leveraging machine learning capabilities based on data from unique run-time logs, which are carefully curated in order to detect malicious activity in the memory of protected processes. This solution achieves reduced overhead and false positives as well as deployment simplicity. We implemented our solution for Windows-based systems, employing multi disciplinary knowledge from malware research, machine learning, and operating system internals. Our experimental evaluation yielded promising results. As we expect future sophisticated malware may try to bypass it, we also discuss how our solution can be extended to thwart such bypassing attempts.

> Many malware campaigns use Microsoft (MS) Office documents as droppers to download and execute their malicious payload. Such campaigns often use these documents because MS Office is installed in billions of devices and that these files allow the execution of arbitrary VBA code. Recent versions of MS Office prevent the automatic execution of VBA macros, so malware authors try to convince users into enabling the content via images that, e.g. forge system or technical errors. In this work, we leverage these visual elements to construct lightweight malware signatures that can be applied with minimal effort. We test and validate our approach using an extensive database of malware samples and identify correlations between different campaigns that illustrate that some campaigns are either using the same tools or that there is some collaboration between them.

> The malware and botnet phenomenon is among the most significant threats to cybersecurity today. Consequently, law enforcement agencies, security companies, and researchers are constantly seeking to disrupt these malicious operations through so-called takedown counter-operations. Unfortunately, the success of these takedowns is mixed. Furthermore, very little is understood as to how botnets and malware delivery operations respond to takedown attempts. We present a comprehensive study of three malware delivery operations that were targeted for takedown in 2015-16 using global download metadata provided by a major security company. In summary, we found that: (1) Distributed delivery architectures were commonly used, indicating the need for better security hygiene and coordination by the (ab)used service providers. (2) A minority of malware binaries were responsible for the majority of download activity, suggesting that detecting these "super binaries" would yield the most benefit to the security community. (3) The malware operations exhibited displacing and defiant behaviours following their respective takedown attempts. We argue that these "predictable" behaviours could be factored into future takedown strategies. (4) The malware operations also exhibited previously undocumented behaviours, such as Dridex dropping competing brands of malware, or Dorkbot and Upatre heavily relying on upstream dropper malware. These "unpredictable" behaviours indicate the need for researchers to use better threat-monitoring techniques.

> Malicious software (malware) poses an increasing threat to the security of communication systems, as the number of interconnected mobile devices increases exponentially. While some existing malware detection and classification approaches successfully leverage network traffic data, they treat network flows between pairs of endpoints independently and thus fail to leverage the rich structural dependencies in the complete network. Our approach first extracts flow graphs and subsequently classifies them using a novel graph neural network model. We present three variants of our base model, which all support malware detection and classification in supervised and unsupervised settings. We evaluate our approach on flow graphs that we extract from a recently published dataset for mobile malware detection that addresses several issues with previously available datasets. Experiments on four different prediction tasks consistently demonstrate the advantages of our approach and show that our graph neural network model can boost detection performance by a significant margin.

> Malware has become a widely used means in cyber attacks in recent decades because of various new obfuscation techniques used by malwares. In order to protect the systems, data and information, detection of malware is needed as early as possible. There are various studies on malware detection techniques that have been done but there is no method which can detect the malware completely and make malware detection problematic. Static Malware analysis is very effective for known malwares but it does not work for zero day malware which leads to the need of dynamic malware detection and the behaviour based malware detection is comparatively good among all detection techniques like signature based, deep learning based, mobile/IOT and cloud based detection but still it is not able to detect all zero day malware which shows the malware detection is very challenging task and need more techniques for malware detection. This paper describes a literature review of various methods of malware detection. A short description of each method is provided and discusses various studies already done in the advanced malware detection field and their comparison based on the detection method used, accuracy and other parameters. Apart from this we will discuss various malware detection tools, dataset and their sources which can be used in further study. This paper gives you the detailed knowledge of advanced malwares, its detection methods, how you can protect your devices and data from malware attacks and it gives the comparison of different studies on malware detection.

Our aim is to detect Android's malware in order to protect the user. To do so really good results are obtained by dynamic analysis of software, but it requires complex environments. In order to achieve the same level of precision we analyze the machine code and investigate the frequencies of ngrams of opcodes in order to detect singular code blocks. This allow us to construct a database of infected code blocks. Then, because attacker may modify and organized differently the infected injected code in their new malware, we perform not only a semantic comparison of the tested software with the database of infected code blocks but also a structured comparison. To do such comparison we compute subgraph isomorphism. It allows us to characterize precisely if the tested software is a malware and if so in witch family it belongs. Our method is tested both on a laboratory database and a set of real data. It achieves an almost perfect detection rate.

> Android is one of the leading operating systems for smart phones in terms of market share and usage. Unfortunately, it is also an appealing target for attackers to compromise its security through malicious applications. To tackle this issue, domain experts and researchers are trying different techniques to stop such attacks. All the attempts of securing Android platform are somewhat successful. However, existing detection techniques have severe shortcomings, including the cumbersome process of feature engineering. Designing representative features require expert domain knowledge. There is a need for minimizing human experts' intervention by circumventing handcrafted feature engineering. Deep learning could be exploited by extracting deep features automatically. Previous work has shown that operational codes (opcodes) of executables provide key information to be used with deep learning models for detection process of malicious applications. The only challenge is to feed opcodes information to deep learning models. Existing techniques use one-hot encoding to tackle the challenge. However, the one-hot encoding scheme has severe limitations. In this paper, we introduce; (1) a novel technique for opcodes embedding, which we name Op2Vec, (2) based on the learned Op2Vec we have developed a dataset for end-to-end detection of android malware. Introducing the end-to-end Android malware detection technique avoids expert-intensive handcrafted features extraction, and ensures automation. The comparison shows that Op2Vec outperforms the existing one-hot encoding technique for opcode embedding and the developed dataset can provide significant insights for end-to-end detection of Android malware.

> Our computer systems for decades have been threatened by various types of hardware and software attacks of which Malwares have been one of them. This malware has the ability to steal, destroy, contaminate, gain unintended access, or even disrupt the entire system. There have been techniques to detect malware by performing static and dynamic analysis of malware files, but, stealthy malware has circumvented the static analysis method and for dynamic analysis, there have been previous works that propose different methods to detect malware but, in this work we propose a novel technique to detect malware. We use malware binary images and then extract different features from the same and then employ different ML-classifiers on the dataset thus obtained. We show that this technique is successful in differentiating classes of malware based on the features extracted.

> This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.

> We propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures (implemented as Hardware/Software co-designs), which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATAa and RATAb - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, RATA substantially reduces computational costs of RA execution.

> As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.

> Mirai is a type of malware that creates a botnet of internet-connected devices, which can later be used to infect other devices or servers. This paper aims to analyze and explain the Mirai code and create a low-cost simulation environment to aid in the dynamic analysis of Mirai. Further, we perform controlled Denial-of-Service attacks while measuring resource consumption on resource-constrained compromised and victim Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as energy consumption, CPU utilization, memory utilization, Ethernet input/output performance, and Secure Digital card usage. The experimental setup shows that when a compromised device sends a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flood, it consumes 38.44% more energy than its regular usage. In the case of Secure Digital usage, the victim, when flooded with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) messages, uses 64.6% more storage for reading and 55.45% more for writing. The significant extra resource consumption caused by Mirai attacks on resource-constrained IoT devices can severely threaten such devices' wide adoption and raises great challenges for the security designs in the resource-constrained IoT environment.

> Research and development of techniques which detect or remediate malicious network activity require access to diverse, realistic, contemporary data sets containing labeled malicious connections. In the absence of such data, said techniques cannot be meaningfully trained, tested, and evaluated. Synthetically produced data containing fabricated or merged network traffic is of limited value as it is easily distinguishable from real traffic by even simple machine learning (ML) algorithms. Real network data is preferable, but while ubiquitous is broadly both sensitive and lacking in ground truth labels, limiting its utility for ML research.   This paper presents a multi-faceted approach to generating a data set of labeled malicious connections embedded within anonymized network traffic collected from large production networks. Real-world malware is defanged and introduced to simulated, secured nodes within those networks to generate realistic traffic while maintaining sufficient isolation to protect real data and infrastructure. Network sensor data, including this embedded malware traffic, is collected at a network edge and anonymized for research use.   Network traffic was collected and produced in accordance with the aforementioned methods at two major educational institutions. The result is a highly realistic, long term, multi-institution data set with embedded data labels spanning over 1.5 trillion connections and over a petabyte of sensor log data. The usability of this data set is demonstrated by its utility to our artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) research program.

The Louvain community detection algorithm was applied to the graph in order to identify existing research communities. The analysis discovered twelve top-level communities: access control, authentication, biometrics, cryptography (I & II), cyber-physical systems, information hiding, intrusion detection, malwares, quantum cryptography, sensor networks, and usable security. These top-level communities were in turn composed of a total of 80 sub-communities. The analysis results are presented for each community in descriptive text, sub-community graphs, and tables with, for example, the most-cited papers and authors. A comparison between the detected communities and topical areas defined by other related work, is also presented, demonstrating a greater researcher emphasis on cryptography, quantum cryptography, information hiding and biometrics, at the expense of laws and regulation, risk management and governance, and security software lifecycle.

Existing threat sharing platforms cannot easily adapt to emerging attack patterns. At the same time, enterprises started to adopt machine learning-based threat detection tools in their local networks. In this paper, we pose the question: \emph{What information can defenders share across multiple networks to help machine learning-based threat detection adapt to new coordinated attacks?} We propose three information sharing methods across two networks, and show how the shared information can be used in a machine-learning network-traffic model to significantly improve its ability of detecting evasive self-propagating malware.

> Emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency-based technologies are redefining the way we conduct business in cyberspace. Today, a myriad of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, applications, and technologies are widely available to companies, end-users, and even malicious actors who want to exploit the computational resources of regular users through \textit{cryptojacking} malware. Especially with ready-to-use mining scripts easily provided by service providers (e.g., Coinhive) and untraceable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Monero), cryptojacking malware has become an indispensable tool for attackers. Indeed, the banking industry, major commercial websites, government and military servers (e.g., US Dept. of Defense), online video sharing platforms (e.g., Youtube), gaming platforms (e.g., Nintendo), critical infrastructure resources (e.g., routers), and even recently widely popular remote video conferencing/meeting programs (e.g., Zoom during the Covid-19 pandemic) have all been the victims of powerful cryptojacking malware campaigns. Nonetheless, existing detection methods such as browser extensions that protect users with blacklist methods or antivirus programs with different analysis methods can only provide a partial panacea to this emerging cryptojacking issue as the attackers can easily bypass them by using obfuscation techniques or changing their domains or scripts frequently. Therefore, many studies in the literature proposed cryptojacking malware detection methods using various dynamic/behavioral features.

> Detecting semantically similar functions -- a crucial analysis capability with broad real-world security usages including vulnerability detection, malware lineage, and forensics -- requires understanding function behaviors and intentions. This task is challenging as semantically similar functions can be implemented differently, run on different architectures, and compiled with diverse compiler optimizations or obfuscations. Most existing approaches match functions based on syntactic features without understanding the functions' execution semantics.   We present Trex, a transfer-learning-based framework, to automate learning execution semantics explicitly from functions' micro-traces and transfer the learned knowledge to match semantically similar functions. Our key insight is that these traces can be used to teach an ML model the execution semantics of different sequences of instructions. We thus train the model to learn execution semantics from the functions' micro-traces, without any manual labeling effort. We then develop a novel neural architecture to learn execution semantics from micro-traces, and we finetune the pretrained model to match semantically similar functions.   We evaluate Trex on 1,472,066 function binaries from 13 popular software projects. These functions are from different architectures and compiled with various optimizations and obfuscations. Trex outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by 7.8%, 7.2%, and 14.3% in cross-architecture, optimization, and obfuscation function matching, respectively. Ablation studies show that the pretraining significantly boosts the function matching performance, underscoring the importance of learning execution semantics.

> Modern commercial antivirus systems increasingly rely on machine learning to keep up with the rampant inflation of new malware. However, it is well-known that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Previous works have shown that ML malware classifiers are fragile to the white-box adversarial attacks. However, ML models used in commercial antivirus products are usually not available to attackers and only return hard classification labels. Therefore, it is more practical to evaluate the robustness of ML models and real-world AVs in a pure black-box manner. We propose a black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework to generate AEs for PE malware classifiers and AV engines. It regards the adversarial attack problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, which finds an optimal balance between exploiting the successful patterns and exploring more varieties. Compared to other frameworks, our improvements lie in three points. 1) Limiting the exploration space by modeling the generation process as a stateless process to avoid combination explosions. 2) Due to the critical role of payload in AE generation, we design to reuse the successful payload in modeling. 3) Minimizing the changes on AE samples to correctly assign the rewards in RL learning. It also helps identify the root cause of evasions. As a result, our framework has much higher black-box evasion rates than other off-the-shelf frameworks. Results show it has over 74\%--97\% evasion rate for two state-of-the-art ML detectors and over 32\%--48\% evasion rate for commercial AVs in a pure black-box setting. We also demonstrate that the transferability of adversarial attacks among ML-based classifiers is higher than the attack transferability between purely ML-based and commercial AVs.

> Machine learning-based malware detection systems are often vulnerable to evasion attacks, in which a malware developer manipulates their malicious software such that it is misclassified as benign. Such software hides some properties of the real class or adopts some properties of a different class by applying small perturbations. A special case of evasive malware hides by repackaging a bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the original functionality of the app, thus retaining most of the benign properties of the original app. We present a novel malware detection system based on metamorphic testing principles that can detect such benign-seeming malware apps. We apply metamorphic testing to the feature representation of the mobile app rather than to the app itself. That is, the source input is the original feature vector for the app and the derived input is that vector with selected features removed. If the app was originally classified benign and is indeed benign, the output for the source and derived inputs should be the same class, i.e., benign, but if they differ, then the app is exposed as likely malware. Malware apps originally classified as malware should retain that classification since only features prevalent in benign apps are removed. This approach enables the machine learning model to classify repackaged malware with reasonably few false negatives and false positives. Our training pipeline is simpler than many existing ML-based malware detection methods, as the network is trained end-to-end to learn appropriate features and perform classification. We pre-trained our classifier model on 3 million apps collected from the widely-used AndroZoo dataset. We perform an extensive study on other publicly available datasets to show our approach's effectiveness in detecting repackaged malware with more than94% accuracy, 0.98 precision, 0.95 recall, and 0.96 F1 score.

> Packing is an obfuscation technique widely used by malware to hide the content and behavior of a program. Much prior research has explored how to detect whether a program is packed. This research includes a broad variety of approaches such as entropy analysis, syntactic signatures and more recently machine learning classifiers using various features. However, no robust results have indicated which algorithms perform best, or which features are most significant. This is complicated by considering how to evaluate the results since accuracy, cost, generalization capabilities, and other measures are all reasonable. This work explores eleven different machine learning approaches using 119 features to understand: which features are most significant for packing detection; which algorithms offer the best performance; and which algorithms are most economical.

> With the continuous rise of malicious campaigns and the exploitation of new attack vectors, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of the defensive mechanisms used to detect them. To this end, the contribution of our work is twofold. First, it introduces a new method for obfuscating malicious code to bypass all static checks of multi-engine scanners, such as VirusTotal. Interestingly, our approach to generating the malicious executables is not based on introducing a new packer but on the augmentation of the capabilities of an existing and widely used tool for packaging Python, PyInstaller but can be used for all similar packaging tools. As we prove, the problem is deeper and inherent in almost all antivirus engines and not PyInstaller specific. Second, our work exposes significant issues of well-known sandboxes that allow malware to evade their checks. As a result, we show that stealth and evasive malware can be efficiently developed, bypassing with ease state of the art malware detection tools without raising any alert.

> Open set recognition (OSR) is the problem of classifying the known classes, meanwhile identifying the unknown classes when the collected samples cannot exhaust all the classes. There are many applications for the OSR problem. For instance, the frequently emerged new malware classes require a system that can classify the known classes and identify the unknown malware classes. In this paper, we propose an add-on extension for loss functions in neural networks to address the OSR problem. Our loss extension leverages the neural network to find polar representations for the known classes so that the representations of the known and the unknown classes become more effectively separable. Our contributions include: First, we introduce an extension that can be incorporated into different loss functions to find more discriminative representations. Second, we show that the proposed extension can significantly improve the performances of two different types of loss functions on datasets from two different domains. Third, we show that with the proposed extension, one loss function outperforms the others in terms of training time and model accuracy.

> We offer an embedding of CPython that runs entirely in memory without "touching" the disk. This in-memory embedding can load Python scripts directly from memory instead these scripts having to be loaded from files on disk. Malware that resides only in memory is harder to detect or mitigate against. We intend for our work to be used by security researchers to rapidly develop and deploy offensive techniques that is difficult for security products to analyze given these instructions are in bytecode and only translated to machine-code by the interpreter immediately prior to execution. Our work helps security researchers and enterprise Red Teams who play offense. Red Teams want to rapidly prototype malware for their periodic campaigns and do not want their malware to be detected by the Incident Response (IR) teams prior to accomplishing objectives. Red Teams also have difficulty running malware in production from files on disk as modern enterprise security products emulate, inspect, or quarantine such executables given these files have no reputation. Our work also helps enterprise Hunt and IR teams by making them aware of the viability of this type of attack. Our approach has been in use in production for over a year and meets our customers' needs to quickly emulate threat-actors' tasks, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

> Malware has become a widely used means in cyber attacks in recent decades because of various new obfuscation techniques used by malwares. In order to protect the systems, data and information, detection of malware is needed as early as possible. There are various studies on malware detection techniques that have been done but there is no method which can detect the malware completely and make malware detection problematic. Static Malware analysis is very effective for known malwares but it does not work for zero day malware which leads to the need of dynamic malware detection and the behaviour based malware detection is comparatively good among all detection techniques like signature based, deep learning based, mobile/IOT and cloud based detection but still it is not able to detect all zero day malware which shows the malware detection is very challenging task and need more techniques for malware detection. This paper describes a literature review of various methods of malware detection. A short description of each method is provided and discusses various studies already done in the advanced malware detection field and their comparison based on the detection method used, accuracy and other parameters. Apart from this we will discuss various malware detection tools, dataset and their sources which can be used in further study. This paper gives you the detailed knowledge of advanced malwares, its detection methods, how you can protect your devices and data from malware attacks and it gives the comparison of different studies on malware detection.

- `2105.05510v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05510v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05510v1)

> Digital investigations of stealthy attacks on Android devices pose particular challenges to incident responders. Whereas consequential late detection demands accurate and comprehensive forensic timelines to reconstruct all malicious activities, reduced forensic footprints with minimal malware involvement, such as when Living-Off-the-Land (LOtL) tactics are adopted, leave investigators little evidence to work with. Volatile memory forensics can be an effective approach since app execution of any form is always bound to leave a trail of evidence in memory, even if perhaps ephemeral. Just-in-Time Memory Forensics (JIT-MF) is a recently proposed technique that describes a framework to process memory forensics on existing stock Android devices, without compromising their security by requiring them to be rooted. Within this framework, JIT-MF drivers are designed to promptly dump in-memory evidence related to app usage or misuse. In this work, we primarily introduce a conceptualized presentation of JIT-MF drivers. Subsequently, through a series of case studies involving the hijacking of widely-used messaging apps, we show that when the target apps are forensically enhanced with JIT-MF drivers, investigators can generate richer forensic timelines to support their investigation, which are on average 26% closer to ground truth.

> Detecting the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) between two input graphs is fundamental for applications in drug synthesis, malware detection, cloud computing, etc. However, MCS computation is NP-hard, and state-of-the-art MCS solvers rely on heuristic search algorithms which in practice cannot find good solution for large graph pairs given a limited computation budget. We propose GLSearch, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based learning to search model. Our model is built upon the branch and bound algorithm, which selects one pair of nodes from the two input graphs to expand at a time. Instead of using heuristics, we propose a novel GNN-based Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select the node pair, allowing the search process faster and more adaptive. To further enhance the training of DQN, we leverage the search process to provide supervision in a pre-training stage and guide our agent during an imitation learning stage. Experiments on synthetic and real-world large graph pairs demonstrate that our model learns a search strategy that is able to detect significantly larger common subgraphs given the same computation budget. Our GLSearch can be potentially extended to solve many other combinatorial problems with constraints on graphs.

> Deep learning is a thriving field currently stuffed with many practical applications and active research topics. It allows computers to learn from experience and to understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each being defined through its relations to simpler concepts. Relying on the strong learning capabilities of deep learning, we propose a convolutional generative adversarial network-based (C-GAN) framework titled MalFox, targeting adversarial malware example generation against third-party black-box detectors. MalFox adopts a novel approach to confrontationally produce perturbation paths, with each formed by up to three methods (namely Obfusmal, Stealmal, and Hollowmal) to generate adversarial malware examples via changing the process of program execution in our implementation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MalFox, we collect a large dataset consisting of both malware and benignware, and investigate the performance of MalFox in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and evasive rate of the generated adversarial malware examples. Our evaluation indicates that the accuracy can be as high as 99.01% which significantly outperforms the other 6 well-known learning models. Furthermore, the detection rate is dramatically decreased by 44.3% on average, and the average evasive rate is noticeably improved by up to 55.3%.

> The development of automated gate specification for quantum communications and quantum networked computation opens up the way for malware designed at corrupting the automation software, changing the automated quantum communications protocols and algorithms. We study two types of attacks on automated quantum communications protocols and simulate these attacks on the superdense coding protocol, using remote access to IBM's Quantum Computers available through IBM Q Experience to simulate these attacks on what would be a low noise quantum communications network. The first type of attack leads to a hacker-controlled bijective transformation of the final measured strings, the second type of attack is a unitary scrambling attack that modifies the automated gate specification to effectively scramble the final measurement, disrupting quantum communications and taking advantage of quantum randomness upon measurement in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish from hardware malfunction or from a sudden rise in environmental noise. We show that, due to quantum entanglement and symmetries, the second type of attack works as a way to strategically disrupt quantum communications networks and quantum networked computation in a way that makes it difficult to ascertain which node was attacked. The main findings are discussed in the wider setting of quantum cybersecurity and quantum networked computation, where ways of hacking including the role of insider threats are discussed.

> The variety of services and functionality offered by various cloud service providers (CSP) have exploded lately. Utilizing such services has created numerous opportunities for enterprises infrastructure to become cloud-based and, in turn, assisted the enterprises to easily and flexibly offer services to their customers. The practice of renting out access to servers to clients for computing and storage purposes is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The popularity of IaaS has led to serious and critical concerns with respect to the cyber security and privacy. In particular, malware is often leveraged by malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive data or to obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware detection for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with numerous methods being proposed and deployed. In this paper, we present online malware detection based on process level performance metrics, and analyze the effectiveness of different baseline machine learning models including, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), KNearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosted Classifier (GBC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our analysis conclude that neural network models can most accurately detect the impact malware have on the process level features of virtual machines in the cloud, and therefore are best suited to detect them. Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running different families of malware (collected from VirusTotal) in a live cloud environment and collecting the process level features.

> With the advent of Industry 4.0, industrial facilities and critical infrastructures are transforming into an ecosystem of heterogeneous physical and cyber components, such as programmable logic controllers, increasingly interconnected and therefore exposed to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that may adversely affect the physical processes underlying industrial control systems. In this paper, we propose a formal approach} based on runtime enforcement to ensure specification compliance in networks of controllers, possibly compromised by colluding malware that may tamper with actuator commands, sensor readings, and inter-controller communications. Our approach relies on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.'s edit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan's Timed Process Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet $P$ of observable actions and a regular timed correctness property $e$, returns a monitor that enforces the property $e$ during the execution of any (potentially corrupted) controller with alphabet $P$, and complying with the property $e$. Our monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted controllers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under scrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical requirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement enjoys deadlock- and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with scalability when dealing with networks of controllers. Finally, we test the proposed enforcement mechanism on a non-trivial case study, taken from the context of industrial water treatment systems, in which the controllers are injected with different malware with different malicious goals.

- *Yizheng Chen, Shiqi Wang, Yue Qin, Xiaojing Liao, Suman Jana, David Wagner*

- `2105.11363v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11363v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11363v1)

> Recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly stronger than local robustness.   In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster increases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.   To the best of our knowledge, the only global robustness property that has been previously achieved is monotonicity. Several previous works have defined global robustness properties, but their training techniques failed to achieve verified global robustness. In comparison, we show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate, compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.

> Large amounts of threat intelligence information about malware attacks are available in disparate, typically unstructured, formats. Knowledge graphs can capture this information and its context using RDF triples represented by entities and relations. Sparse or inaccurate threat information, however, leads to challenges such as incomplete or erroneous triples. Generic information extraction (IE) models used to populate the knowledge graph cannot fully guarantee domain-specific context. This paper proposes a system to generate a Malware Knowledge Graph called MalKG, the first open-source automated knowledge graph for malware threat intelligence. MalKG dataset (MT40K\footnote{ Anonymous GitHub link: https://github.com/malkg-researcher/MalKG}) contains approximately 40,000 triples generated from 27,354 unique entities and 34 relations. For ground truth, we manually curate a knowledge graph called MT3K, with 3,027 triples generated from 5,741 unique entities and 22 relations. We demonstrate the intelligence prediction of MalKG using two use cases. Predicting malware threat information using the benchmark model achieves 80.4 for the hits@10 metric (predicts the top 10 options for an information class), and 0.75 for the MRR (mean reciprocal rank). We also propose an automated, contextual framework for information extraction, both manually and automatically, at the sentence level from 1,100 malware threat reports and from the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) database.

> With the growing popularity of Android devices, Android malware is seriously threatening the safety of users. Although such threats can be detected by deep learning as a service (DLaaS), deep neural networks as the weakest part of DLaaS are often deceived by the adversarial samples elaborated by attackers. In this paper, we propose a new semi-black-box attack framework called one-feature-each-iteration (OFEI) to craft Android adversarial samples. This framework modifies as few features as possible and requires less classifier information to fool the classifier. We conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate our OFEI framework by comparing it with the benchmark methods JSMF, GenAttack and pointwise attack. The experimental results show that our OFEI has a higher misclassification rate of 98.25%. Furthermore, OFEI can extend the traditional white-box attack methods in the image field, such as fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and DeepFool, to craft adversarial samples for Android. Finally, to enhance the security of DLaaS, we use two uncertainties of the Bayesian neural network to construct the combined uncertainty, which is used to detect adversarial samples and achieves a high detection rate of 99.28%.

> While machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated a strong ability in detecting Android malware, they can be evaded by sparse evasion attacks crafted by injecting a small set of fake components, e.g., permissions and system calls, without compromising intrusive functionality. Previous work has shown that, to improve robustness against such attacks, learning algorithms should avoid overemphasizing few discriminant features, providing instead decisions that rely upon a large subset of components. In this work, we investigate whether gradient-based attribution methods, used to explain classifiers' decisions by identifying the most relevant features, can be used to help identify and select more robust algorithms. To this end, we propose to exploit two different metrics that represent the evenness of explanations, and a new compact security measure called Adversarial Robustness Metric. Our experiments conducted on two different datasets and five classification algorithms for Android malware detection show that a strong connection exists between the uniformity of explanations and adversarial robustness. In particular, we found that popular techniques like Gradient*Input and Integrated Gradients are strongly correlated to security when applied to both linear and nonlinear detectors, while more elementary explanation techniques like the simple Gradient do not provide reliable information about the robustness of such classifiers.

> Android malware detection is a significat problem that affects billions of users using millions of Android applications (apps) in existing markets. This paper proposes PetaDroid, a framework for accurate Android malware detection and family clustering on top of static analyses. PetaDroid automatically adapts to Android malware and benign changes over time with resilience to common binary obfuscation techniques. The framework employs novel techniques elaborated on top of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate, adaptive, and resilient Android malware detection and family clustering. PetaDroid identifies malware using an ensemble of convolutional neural network (CNN) on proposed Inst2Vec features. The framework clusters the detected malware samples into malware family groups utilizing sample feature digests generated using deep neural auto-encoder. For change adaptation, PetaDroid leverages the detection confidence probability during deployment to automatically collect extension datasets and periodically use them to build new malware detection models. Besides, PetaDroid uses code-fragment randomization during the training to enhance the resiliency to common obfuscation techniques. We extensively evaluated PetaDroid on multiple reference datasets. PetaDroid achieved a high detection rate (98-99% f1-score) under different evaluation settings with high homogeneity in the produced clusters (96%). We conducted a thorough quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art solutions MaMaDroid, DroidAPIMiner, MalDozer, in which PetaDroid outperforms them under all the evaluation settings.

> We present BPFroid -- a novel dynamic analysis framework for Android that uses the eBPF technology of the Linux kernel to continuously monitor events of user applications running on a real device. The monitored events are collected from different components of the Android software stack: internal kernel functions, system calls, native library functions, and the Java API framework. As BPFroid hooks these events in the kernel, a malware is unable to trivially bypass monitoring. Moreover, using eBPF doesn't require any change to the Android system or the monitored applications. We also present an analytical comparison of BPFroid to other malware detection methods and demonstrate its usage by developing novel signatures to detect suspicious behavior that are based on it. These signatures are then evaluated using real apps. We also demonstrate how BPFroid can be used to capture forensic artifacts for further investigation. Our results show that BPFroid successfully alerts in real time when a suspicious behavioral signature is detected, without incurring a significant runtime performance overhead.

> Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples (AEs) with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. However, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic AEs in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Finally, we present robustness certification utilizing non-uniform perturbation bounds, and show that non-uniform bounds achieve better certification.

> Economic incentives encourage malware authors to constantly develop new, increasingly complex malware to steal sensitive data or blackmail individuals and companies into paying large ransoms. In 2017, the worldwide economic impact of cyberattacks is estimated to be between 445 and 600 billion USD, or 0.8% of global GDP. Traditionally, one of the approaches used to defend against malware is network traffic analysis, which relies on network data to detect the presence of potentially malicious software. However, to keep up with increasing network speeds and amount of traffic, network analysis is generally limited to work on aggregated network data, which is traditionally challenging and yields mixed results. In this paper we present MalPhase, a system that was designed to cope with the limitations of aggregated flows. MalPhase features a multi-phase pipeline for malware detection, type and family classification. The use of an extended set of network flow features and a simultaneous multi-tier architecture facilitates a performance improvement for deep learning models, making them able to detect malicious flows (>98% F1) and categorize them to a respective malware type (>93% F1) and family (>91% F1). Furthermore, the use of robust features and denoising autoencoders allows MalPhase to perform well on samples with varying amounts of benign traffic mixed in. Finally, MalPhase detects unseen malware samples with performance comparable to that of known samples, even when interlaced with benign flows to reflect realistic network environments.

> Malicious software (malware) poses an increasing threat to the security of communication systems as the number of interconnected mobile devices increases exponentially. While some existing malware detection and classification approaches successfully leverage network traffic data, they treat network flows between pairs of endpoints independently and thus fail to leverage rich communication patterns present in the complete network. Our approach first extracts flow graphs and subsequently classifies them using a novel edge feature-based graph neural network model. We present three variants of our base model, which support malware detection and classification in supervised and unsupervised settings. We evaluate our approach on flow graphs that we extract from a recently published dataset for mobile malware detection that addresses several issues with previously available datasets. Experiments on four different prediction tasks consistently demonstrate the advantages of our approach and show that our graph neural network model can boost detection performance by a significant margin.

> Classifying network traffic is the basis for important network applications. Prior research in this area has faced challenges on the availability of representative datasets, and many of the results cannot be readily reproduced. Such a problem is exacerbated by emerging data-driven machine learning based approaches. To address this issue, we present(N et)2databasewith three open datasets containing nearly 1.3M labeled flows in total, with a comprehensive list of flow features, for there search community1. We focus on broad aspects in network traffic analysis, including both malware detection and application classification. As we continue to grow them, we expect the datasets to serve as a common ground for AI driven, reproducible research on network flow analytics. We release the datasets publicly and also introduce a Multi-Task Hierarchical Learning (MTHL)model to perform all tasks in a single model. Our results show that MTHL is capable of accurately performing multiple tasks with hierarchical labeling with a dramatic reduction in training time.

- `2010.14605v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14605v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14605v3)

> Network management often relies on machine learning to make predictions about performance and security from network traffic. Often, the representation of the traffic is as important as the choice of the model. The features that the model relies on, and the representation of those features, ultimately determine model accuracy, as well as where and whether the model can be deployed in practice. Thus, the design and evaluation of these models ultimately requires understanding not only model accuracy but also the systems costs associated with deploying the model in an operational network. Towards this goal, this paper develops a new framework and system that enables a joint evaluation of both the conventional notions of machine learning performance (e.g., model accuracy) and the systems-level costs of different representations of network traffic. We highlight these two dimensions for two practical network management tasks, video streaming quality inference and malware detection, to demonstrate the importance of exploring different representations to find the appropriate operating point. We demonstrate the benefit of exploring a range of representations of network traffic and present Traffic Refinery, a proof-of-concept implementation that both monitors network traffic at 10 Gbps and transforms traffic in real time to produce a variety of feature representations for machine learning. Traffic Refinery both highlights this design space and makes it possible to explore different representations for learning, balancing systems costs related to feature extraction and model training against model accuracy.

> In this paper we present LiM ("Less is More"), a malware classification framework that leverages Federated Learning to detect and classify malicious apps in a privacy-respecting manner. Information about newly installed apps is kept locally on users' devices, so that the provider cannot infer which apps were installed by users. At the same time, input from all users is taken into account in the federated learning process and they all benefit from better classification performance. A key challenge of this setting is that users do not have access to the ground truth (i.e. they cannot correctly identify whether an app is malicious). To tackle this, LiM uses a safe semi-supervised ensemble that maximizes classification accuracy with respect to a baseline classifier trained by the service provider (i.e. the cloud). We implement LiM and show that the cloud server has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect recall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean apps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation. Furthermore, we conduct a security analysis and demonstrate that LiM is robust against both poisoning attacks by adversaries who control half of the clients, and inference attacks performed by an honest-but-curious cloud server. Further experiments with MaMaDroid's dataset confirm resistance against poisoning attacks and a performance improvement due to the federation.

> Despite the considerable success of neural networks in security settings such as malware detection, such models have proved vulnerable to evasion attacks, in which attackers make slight changes to inputs (e.g., malware) to bypass detection. We propose a novel approach, \emph{Fourier stabilization}, for designing evasion-robust neural networks with binary inputs. This approach, which is complementary to other forms of defense, replaces the weights of individual neurons with robust analogs derived using Fourier analytic tools. The choice of which neurons to stabilize in a neural network is then a combinatorial optimization problem, and we propose several methods for approximately solving it. We provide a formal bound on the per-neuron drop in accuracy due to Fourier stabilization, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in boosting robustness of neural networks in several detection settings. Moreover, we show that our approach effectively composes with adversarial training.

> A wide range of binary analysis applications, such as bug discovery, malware analysis and code clone detection, require recovery of contextual meanings on a binary code. Recently, binary analysis techniques based on machine learning have been proposed to automatically reconstruct the code representation of a binary instead of manually crafting specifics of the analysis algorithm. However, the existing approaches utilizing machine learning are still specialized to solve one domain of problems, rendering recreation of models for different types of binary analysis. In this paper, we propose DeepSemantic utilizing BERT in producing the semantic-aware code representation of a binary code.   To this end, we introduce well-balanced instruction normalization that holds rich information for each of instructions yet minimizing an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. DeepSemantic has been carefully designed based on our study with large swaths of binaries. Besides, DeepSemantic leverages the essence of the BERT architecture into re-purposing a pre-trained generic model that is readily available as a one-time processing, followed by quickly applying specific downstream tasks with a fine-tuning process. We demonstrate DeepSemantic with two downstream tasks, namely, binary similarity comparison and compiler provenance (i.e., compiler and optimization level) prediction. Our experimental results show that the binary similarity model outperforms two state-of-the-art binary similarity tools, DeepBinDiff and SAFE, 49.84% and 15.83% on average, respectively.

> The constant growth in the number of malware - software or code fragment potentially harmful for computers and information networks - and the use of sophisticated evasion and obfuscation techniques have seriously hindered classic signature-based approaches. On the other hand, malware detection systems based on machine learning techniques started offering a promising alternative to standard approaches, drastically reducing analysis time and turning out to be more robust against evasion and obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we propose a malware taxonomic classification pipeline able to classify Windows Portable Executable files (PEs). Given an input PE sample, it is first classified as either malicious or benign. If malicious, the pipeline further analyzes it in order to establish its threat type, family, and behavior(s). We tested the proposed pipeline on the open source dataset EMBER, containing approximately 1 million PE samples, analyzed through static analysis. Obtained malware detection results are comparable to other academic works in the current state of art and, in addition, we provide an in-depth classification of malicious samples. Models used in the pipeline provides interpretable results which can help security analysts in better understanding decisions taken by the automated pipeline.

> Mobile apps are extensively involved in cyber-crimes. Some apps are malware which compromise users' devices, while some others may lead to privacy leakage. Apart from them, there also exist apps which directly make profit from victims through deceiving, threatening or other criminal actions. We name these apps as CULPRITWARE. They have become emerging threats in recent years. However, the characteristics and the ecosystem of CULPRITWARE remain mysterious. This paper takes the first step towards systematically studying CULPRITWARE and its ecosystem. Specifically, we first characterize CULPRITWARE by categorizing and comparing them with benign apps and malware. The result shows that CULPRITWARE have unique features, e.g., the usage of app generators (25.27%) deviates from that of benign apps (5.08%) and malware (0.43%). Such a discrepancy can be used to distinguish CULPRITWARE from benign apps and malware. Then we understand the structure of the ecosystem by revealing the four participating entities (i.e., developer, agent, operator and reaper) and the workflow. After that, we further reveal the characteristics of the ecosystem by studying the participating entities. Our investigation shows that the majority of CULPRITWARE (at least 52.08%) are propagated through social media rather than the official app markets, and most CULPRITWARE (96%) indirectly rely on the covert fourth-party payment services to transfer the profits. Our findings shed light on the ecosystem, and can facilitate the community and law enforcement authorities to mitigate the threats. We will release the source code of our tools to engage the community.

> Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of novelty detection (or ``anomaly detection'') methods in machine learning. The data representation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these models as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network operators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in traffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible models and data representations. In each scenario, practitioners must spend significant effort extracting and engineering features that are most predictive for that situation or application. While anomaly detection is well-studied in computer networking, much existing work develops specific models that presume a particular representation -- often IPFIX/NetFlow. Yet, other representations may result in higher model accuracy, and the rise of programmable networks now makes it more practical to explore a broader range of representations. To facilitate such exploration, we develop a systematic framework, open-source toolkit, and public Python library that makes it both possible and easy to extract and generate features from network traffic and perform and end-to-end evaluation of these representations across most prevalent modern novelty detection models. We first develop and publicly release an open-source tool, an accompanying Python library (NetML), and end-to-end pipeline for novelty detection in network traffic. Second, we apply this tool to five different novelty detection problems in networking, across a range of scenarios from attack detection to novel device detection. Our findings general insights and guidelines concerning which features appear to be more appropriate for particular situations.

> On-device machine learning (ML) is quickly gaining popularity among mobile apps. It allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, ML models, considered as core intellectual properties of model owners, are now stored on billions of untrusted devices and subject to potential thefts. Leaked models can cause both severe financial loss and security consequences. This paper presents the first empirical study of ML model protection on mobile devices. Our study aims to answer three open questions with quantitative evidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing model protection techniques? What impacts can (stolen) models incur? To that end, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps collected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps spanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps do not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app packages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were able to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic analysis techniques. The extracted models are mostly commercial products and used for face recognition, liveness detection, ID/bank card recognition, and malware detection. We quantitatively estimated the potential financial and security impact of a leaked model, which can amount to millions of dollars for different stakeholders. Our study reveals that on-device models are currently at high risk of being leaked; attackers are highly motivated to steal such models. Drawn from our large-scale study, we report our insights into this emerging security problem and discuss the technical challenges, hoping to inspire future research on robust and practical model protection for mobile devices.

> The use of Machine Learning has become a significant part of malware detection efforts due to the influx of new malware, an ever changing threat landscape, and the ability of Machine Learning methods to discover meaningful distinctions between malicious and benign software. Antivirus vendors have also begun to widely utilize malware classifiers based on dynamic and static malware analysis features. Therefore, a malware author might make evasive binary modifications against Machine Learning models as part of the malware development life cycle to execute an attack successfully. This makes the studying of possible classifier evasion strategies an essential part of cyber defense against malice. To this extent, we stage a grey box setup to analyze a scenario where the malware author does not know the target classifier algorithm, and does not have access to decisions made by the classifier, but knows the features used in training. In this experiment, a malicious actor trains a surrogate model using the EMBER-2018 dataset to discover binary mutations that cause an instance to be misclassified via a Monte Carlo tree search. Then, mutated malware is sent to the victim model that takes the place of an antivirus API to test whether it can evade detection.

> The number of Android malware variants (clones) are on the rise and, to stop this attack of clones we need to develop new methods and techniques for analysing and detecting them. As a first step, we need to study how these malware clones are generated. This will help us better anticipate and recognize these clones. In this paper we present a new tool named DroidMorph, that provides morphing of Android applications (APKs) at different level of abstractions, and can be used to create Android application (malware/benign) clones. As a case study we perform testing and evaluating resilience of current commercial anti-malware products against attack of the Android malware clones generated by DroidMorph. We found that 8 out of 17 leading commercial anti-malware programs were not able to detect any of the morphed APKs. We hope that DroidMorph will be used in future research, to improve Android malware clones analysis and detection, and help stop them.

> Cybersecurity is a very emerging field that protects systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. With the increase in the scale of the Internet and the evolution of cyber attacks, developing novel cybersecurity tools has become important, particularly for Internet of things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a systematic review of the application of deep learning (DL) approaches for cybersecurity. This paper provides a short description of DL methods which is used in cybersecurity, including deep belief networks, generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and others. Next, we illustrate the differences between shallow learning and DL. Moreover, a discussion is provided on the currently prevailing cyber-attacks in IoT and other networks, and the effectiveness of DL methods to manage these attacks. Besides, this paper describes studies that highlight the DL technique, cybersecurity applications, and the source of datasets. Next, a discussion is provided on the feasibility of DL systems for malware detection and classification, intrusion detection, and other frequent cyber-attacks, including identifying file type, spam, and network traffic. Our review indicates that high classification accuracy of 99.72% is obtained by restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) when applied to a custom dataset, while long short-term memory (LSTM) achieves an accuracy of 99.80% for KDD Cup 99 dataset. Finally, this article discusses the importance of cybersecurity for reliable and practicable IoT-driven healthcare systems.

> Malware currently presents a number of serious threats to computer users. Signature-based malware detection methods are limited in detecting new malware samples that are significantly different from known ones. Therefore, machine learning-based methods have been proposed, but there are two challenges these methods face. The first is to model the full semantics behind the assembly code of malware. The second challenge is to provide interpretable results while keeping excellent detection performance. In this paper, we propose an Interpretable MAlware Detector (I-MAD) that outperforms state-of-the-art static malware detection models regarding accuracy with excellent interpretability. To improve the detection performance, I-MAD incorporates a novel network component called the Galaxy Transformer network that can understand assembly code at the basic block, function, and executable levels. It also incorporates our proposed interpretable feed-forward neural network to provide interpretations for its detection results by quantifying the impact of each feature with respect to the prediction. Experiment results show that our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art static malware detection models and presents meaningful interpretations.

> Data augmentation has been successfully used in many areas of deep-learning to significantly improve model performance. Typically data augmentation simulates realistic variations in data in order to increase the apparent diversity of the training-set. However, for opcode-based malware analysis, where deep learning methods are already achieving state of the art performance, it is not immediately clear how to apply data augmentation. In this paper we study different methods of data augmentation starting with basic methods using fixed transformations and moving to methods that adapt to the data. We propose a novel data augmentation method based on using an opcode embedding layer within the network and its corresponding opcode embedding matrix to perform adaptive data augmentation during training. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to carry out a systematic study of different augmentation methods applied to opcode sequence based malware classification.

> Many users implicitly assume that software can only be exploited after it is installed. However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45% in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.

> Detecting the newly emerging malware variants in real time is crucial for mitigating cyber risks and proactively blocking intrusions. In this paper, we propose MG-DVD, a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time. Particularly, MG-DVD first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between malware objects, which can effectively characterize more discriminative malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then, MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants, which significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result, MG-DVD is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time, and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed MG-DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

> Numerous malware families rely on domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish a connection to their command and control (C2) server. Counteracting DGAs, several machine learning classifiers have been proposed enabling the identification of the DGA that generated a specific domain name and thus triggering targeted remediation measures. However, the proposed state-of-the-art classifiers are based on deep learning models. The black box nature of these makes it difficult to evaluate their reasoning. The resulting lack of confidence makes the utilization of such models impracticable. In this paper, we propose EXPLAIN, a feature-based and contextless DGA multiclass classifier. We comparatively evaluate several combinations of feature sets and hyperparameters for our approach against several state-of-the-art classifiers in a unified setting on the same real-world data. Our classifier achieves competitive results, is real-time capable, and its predictions are easier to trace back to features than the predictions made by the DGA multiclass classifiers proposed in related work.

> Detecting the newly emerging malware variants in real time is crucial for mitigating cyber risks and proactively blocking intrusions. In this paper, we propose MG-DVD, a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time. Particularly, MG-DVD first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between malware objects, which can effectively characterize more discriminative malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then, MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants, which significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result, MG-DVD is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time, and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed MG-DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

> Numerous metamorphic and polymorphic malicious variants are generated automatically on a daily basis by mutation engines that transform the code of a malicious program while retaining its functionality, in order to evade signature-based detection. These automatic processes have greatly increased the number of malware variants, deeming their fully-manual analysis impossible. Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered malicious programs and applications helps assess the risks they pose. Moreover, malware classification facilitates determining which of the newly discovered variants should undergo manual analysis by a security expert, in order to determine whether they belong to a new family (e.g., one whose members exploit a zero-day vulnerability) or are simply the result of a concept drift within a known malicious family. This motivated intense research in recent years on devising high-accuracy automatic tools for malware classification. In this work, we present DAEMON - a novel dataset-agnostic malware classifier. A key property of DAEMON is that the type of features it uses and the manner in which they are mined facilitate understanding the distinctive behavior of malware families, making its classification decisions explainable. We've optimized DAEMON using a large-scale dataset of x86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware families targeting computers running Windows. We then re-trained it and applied it, without any algorithmic change, feature re-engineering or parameter tuning, to two other large-scale datasets of malicious Android applications consisting of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained highly accurate classification results on all datasets, establishing that it is also platform-agnostic.

> The widespread significance of Android IoT devices is due to its flexibility and hardware support features which revolutionized the digital world by introducing exciting applications almost in all walks of daily life, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart environments, safety, remote sensing, and many more. Such versatile applicability gives incentive for more malware attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework which continuously aggregates multiple user trained models on non-overlapping data into single model. Specifically for malware detection task, (i) we propose a novel user (local) neural network (LNN) which trains on local distribution and (ii) then to assure the model authenticity and quality, we propose a novel smart contract which enable aggregation process over blokchain platform. The LNN model analyzes various static and dynamic features of both malware and benign whereas the smart contract verifies the malicious applications both for uploading and downloading processes in the network using stored aggregated features of local models. In this way, the proposed model not only improves malware detection accuracy using decentralized model network but also model efficacy with blockchain. We evaluate our approach with three state-of-the-art models and performed deep analyses of extracted features of the relative model.

> Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to evasion attacks. Evasion accuracy is typically assessed using aggregate evasion rate, and it is an open question whether aggregate evasion rate enables feature-level diagnosis on the effect of adversarial perturbations on evasive predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that harnesses explainable ML methods to guide high-fidelity assessment of ML evasion attacks. Our framework enables explanation-guided correlation analysis between pre-evasion perturbations and post-evasion explanations. Towards systematic assessment of ML evasion attacks, we propose and evaluate a novel suite of model-agnostic metrics for sample-level and dataset-level correlation analysis. Using malware and image classifiers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse model architectures and complementary feature representations. Our explanation-guided correlation analysis reveals correlation gaps between adversarial samples and the corresponding perturbations performed on them. Using a case study on explanation-guided evasion, we show the broader usage of our methodology for assessing robustness of ML models.

> The malware and botnet phenomenon is among the most significant threats to cybersecurity today. Consequently, law enforcement agencies, security companies, and researchers are constantly seeking to disrupt these malicious operations through so-called takedown counter-operations. Unfortunately, the success of these takedowns is mixed. Furthermore, very little is understood as to how botnets and malware delivery operations respond to takedown attempts. We present a comprehensive study of three malware delivery operations that were targeted for takedown in 2015-16 using global download metadata provided by a major security company. In summary, we found that: (1) Distributed delivery architectures were commonly used, indicating the need for better security hygiene and coordination by the (ab)used service providers. (2) A minority of malware binaries were responsible for the majority of download activity, suggesting that detecting these "super binaries" would yield the most benefit to the security community. (3) The malware operations exhibited displacing and defiant behaviours following their respective takedown attempts. We argue that these "predictable" behaviours could be factored into future takedown strategies. (4) The malware operations also exhibited previously undocumented behaviours, such as Dridex dropping competing brands of malware, or Dorkbot and Upatre heavily relying on upstream dropper malware. These "unpredictable" behaviours indicate the need for researchers to use better threat-monitoring techniques.

> Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a class of powerful machine learning techniques, where both a generative and discriminative model are trained simultaneously. GANs have been used, for example, to successfully generate "deep fake" images. A recent trend in malware research consists of treating executables as images and employing image-based analysis techniques. In this research, we generate fake malware images using auxiliary classifier GANs (AC-GAN), and we consider the effectiveness of various techniques for classifying the resulting images. Our results indicate that the resulting multiclass classification problem is challenging, yet we can obtain strong results when restricting the problem to distinguishing between real and fake samples. While the AC-GAN generated images often appear to be very similar to real malware images, we conclude that from a deep learning perspective, the AC-GAN generated samples do not rise to the level of deep fake malware images.

In this research, we perform a variety of experiments on a significant number of malware families to determine when malware evolution is likely to have occurred. All of the evolution detection techniques that we consider are based on machine learning and can be fully automated -- in particular, no reverse engineering or other labor-intensive manual analysis is required. Specifically, we consider analysis based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and the word embedding techniques HMM2Vec and Word2Vec.

> Android malware is one of the most dangerous threats on the internet, and it's been on the rise for several years. Despite significant efforts in detecting and classifying android malware from innocuous android applications, there is still a long way to go. As a result, there is a need to provide a basic understanding of the behavior displayed by the most common Android malware categories and families. Each Android malware family and category has a distinct objective. As a result, it has impacted every corporate area, including healthcare, banking, transportation, government, and e-commerce. In this paper, we presented two machine-learning approaches for Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware: one for detecting and identifying Android Malware Categories and the other for detecting and identifying Android Malware Families, which was accomplished by analyzing a massive malware dataset with 14 prominent malware categories and 180 prominent malware families of CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 dataset on Dynamic Layers. Our approach achieves in Android Malware Category detection more than 96 % accurate and achieves in Android Malware Family detection more than 99% accurate. Our approach provides a method for high-accuracy Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware while also shortening the time required to analyze smartphone malware.

> The design of attacks for cyber physical systems is critical to assess CPS resilience at design time and run-time, and to generate rich datasets from testbeds for research. Attacks against cyber physical systems distinguish themselves from IT attacks in that the main objective is to harm the physical system. Therefore, both cyber and physical system knowledge are needed to design such attacks. The current practice to generate attacks either focuses on the cyber part of the system using IT cyber security existing body of knowledge, or uses heuristics to inject attacks that could potentially harm the physical process. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to automatically generate integrity attacks from the CPS safety and control specifications, without knowledge of the physical system or its dynamics. The generated attacks violate the system operational and safety requirements, hence present a genuine test for system resilience. We present an algorithm to automate the malware payload development. Several examples are given throughout the paper to illustrate the proposed approach.

> Android is among the most targeted platform by attackers. While attackers are improving their techniques, traditional solutions based on static and dynamic analysis have been also evolving. In addition to the application code, Android applications have some metadata that could be useful for security analysis of applications. Unlike traditional application distribution mechanisms, Android applications are distributed centrally in mobile markets. Therefore, beside application packages, such markets contain app information provided by app developers and app users. The availability of such useful textual data together with the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to process and understand textual data has encouraged researchers to investigate the use of NLP techniques in Android security. Especially, security solutions based on NLP have accelerated in the last 5 years and proven to be useful. This study reviews these proposals and aim to explore possible research directions for future studies by presenting state-of-the-art in this domain. We mainly focus on NLP-based solutions under four categories: description-to-behaviour fidelity, description generation, privacy and malware detection.

> Due to its open-source nature, Android operating system has been the main target of attackers to exploit. Malware creators always perform different code obfuscations on their apps to hide malicious activities. Features extracted from these obfuscated samples through program analysis contain many useless and disguised features, which leads to many false negatives. To address the issue, in this paper, we demonstrate that obfuscation-resilient malware analysis can be achieved through contrastive learning. We take the Android malware classification as an example to demonstrate our analysis. The key insight behind our analysis is that contrastive learning can be used to reduce the difference introduced by obfuscation while amplifying the difference between malware and benign apps (or other types of malware).   Based on the proposed analysis, we design a system that can achieve robust and interpretable classification of Android malware. To achieve robust classification, we perform contrastive learning on malware samples to learn an encoder that can automatically extract robust features from malware samples. To achieve interpretable classification, we transform the function call graph of a sample into an image by centrality analysis. Then the corresponding heatmaps are obtained by visualization techniques. These heatmaps can help users understand why the malware is classified as this family. We implement IFDroid and perform extensive evaluations on two widely used datasets. Experimental results show that IFDroid is superior to state-of-the-art Android malware familial classification systems. Moreover, IFDroid is capable of maintaining 98.2% true positive rate on classifying 8,112 obfuscated malware samples.

> Malicious activities in cyberspace have gone further than simply hacking machines and spreading viruses. It has become a challenge for a nations survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification framework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification (DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by fusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it against the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented in two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and fine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning. The proposed classification framework DFS-MC showed improved results, Accuracy: 98.61%, F-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.

> Android has become the most popular mobile operating system. Correspondingly, an increasing number of Android malware has been developed and spread to steal users' private information. There exists one type of malware whose benign behaviors are developed to camouflage malicious behaviors. The malicious component occupies a small part of the entire code of the application (app for short), and the malicious part is strongly coupled with the benign part. In this case, the malware may cause false negatives when malware detectors extract features from the entire apps to conduct classification because the malicious features of these apps may be hidden among benign features. Moreover, some previous work aims to divide the entire app into several parts to discover the malicious part. However, the premise of these methods to commence app partition is that the connections between the normal part and the malicious part are weak.   In this paper, we call this type of malware as Android covert malware and generate the first dataset of covert malware. To detect them, we first conduct static analysis to extract the call graphs. Through the deep analysis on graphs, we observe that although the correlations between the normal part and the malicious part in these graphs are high, the degree of these correlations has a distribution. Based on the observation, we design HomDroid to detect covert malware by analyzing the homophily of call graphs. We identify the ideal threshold of correlation to distinguish the normal part and the malicious part based on the evaluation results on a dataset of 4,840 benign apps and 3,385 covert malicious apps. According to our evaluation results, HomDroid is capable of detecting 96.8% of covert malware while the False Negative Rates of another four state-of-the-art systems (i.e., PerDroid, Drebin, MaMaDroid, and IntDroid) are 30.7%, 16.3%, 15.2%, and 10.4%, respectively.

> How can we identify similar repositories and clusters among a large online archive, such as GitHub? Determiningrepository similarity is an essential building block in studying the dynamics and the evolution of such software ecosystems. The key challenge is to determine the right representation for the diverse repository features in a way that: (a) it captures all aspects of the available information, and (b) it is readily usable by MLalgorithms. We propose Repo2Vec, a comprehensive embedding approach to represent a repository as a distributed vector by combining features from three types of information sources. As our key novelty, we consider three types of information: (a)metadata, (b) the structure of the repository, and (c) the source code. We also introduce a series of embedding approaches to represent and combine these information types into a single embedding. We evaluate our method with two real datasets from GitHub for a combined 1013 repositories. First, we show that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of precision (93%vs 78%), with nearly twice as many Strongly Similar repositories and 30% fewer False Positives. Second, we show how Repo2Vecprovides a solid basis for: (a) distinguishing between malware and benign repositories, and (b) identifying a meaningful hierarchical clustering. For example, we achieve 98% precision and 96%recall in distinguishing malware and benign repositories. Overall, our work is a fundamental building block for enabling many repository analysis functions such as repository categorization by target platform or intention, detecting code-reuse and clones, and identifying lineage and evolution.

> Delivering malware covertly and detection-evadingly is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a method that delivers malware covertly and detection-evadingly through neural network models. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware into the neurons, malware can be delivered covertly with minor or even no impact on the performance of neural networks. Meanwhile, since the structure of the neural network models remains unchanged, they can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded into a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicious are raised by antivirus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks becomes a forwarding trend of malware. We hope this work could provide a referenceable scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks.

> Modern ransomware often generate and manage cryptographic keys on the victim's machine, giving defenders an opportunity to capture exposed keys and recover encrypted data without paying the ransom. However, recent work has raised the possibility of future enclave-enhanced malware that could avoid such mitigations using emerging support for hardware-enforced secure enclaves in commodity CPUs. Nonetheless, the practicality of such enclave-enhanced malware and its potential impact on all phases of the ransomware lifecyle remain unclear. Given the demonstrated capacity of ransomware authors to innovate in order to better extort their victims (e.g. through the adoption of untraceable virtual currencies and anonymity networks), it is important to better understand the risks involved and identify potential mitigations.   As a basis for comprehensive security and performance analysis of enclave-enhanced ransomware, we present RansomClave, a family of ransomware that securely manage their cryptographic keys using an enclave. We use RansomClave to explore the implications of enclave-enhanced ransomware for the key generation, encryption and key release phases of the ransomware lifecycle, and to identify potential limitations and mitigations.   We propose two plausible victim models and analyse, from an attacker's perspective, how RansomClave can protect cryptographic keys from each type of victim. We find that some existing mitigations are likely to be effective during the key generation and encryption phases, but that RansomClave enables new trustless key release schemes that could potentially improve attacker's profitability and, by extension, make enclaves an attractive target for future attackers.

We survey recent research at the intersection of security and privacy and generative models. In particular, we discuss the use of generative models in adversarial machine learning, in helping automate or enhance existing attacks, and as building blocks for defenses in contexts such as intrusion detection, biometrics spoofing, and malware obfuscation. We also describe the use of generative models in diverse applications such as fairness in machine learning, privacy-preserving data synthesis, and steganography. Finally, we discuss new threats due to generative models: the creation of synthetic media such as deepfakes that can be used for disinformation.

> Malware detection and analysis are active research subjects in cybersecurity over the last years. Indeed, the development of obfuscation techniques, as packing, for example, requires special attention to detect recent variants of malware. The usual detection methods do not necessarily provide tools to interpret the results. Therefore, we propose a model based on the transformation of binary files into grayscale image, which achieves an accuracy rate of 88%. Furthermore, the proposed model can determine if a sample is packed or encrypted with a precision of 85%. It allows us to analyze results and act appropriately. Also, by applying attention mechanisms on detection models, we have the possibility to identify which part of the files looks suspicious. This kind of tool should be very useful for data analysts, it compensates for the lack of interpretability of the common detection models, and it can help to understand why some malicious files are undetected.

> Mobile malware are malicious programs that target mobile devices. They are an increasing problem, as seen in the rise of detected mobile malware samples per year. The number of active smartphone users is expected to grow, stressing the importance of research on the detection of mobile malware. Detection methods for mobile malware exist but are still limited.   In this paper, we provide an overview of the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect malware on Android, without using privileged access. The ML-classifiers use device information such as the CPU usage, battery usage, and memory usage for the detection of 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans on the Android Operating System (OS).   We use a real-life dataset containing device and malware data from 47 users for a year (2016). We examine which features, i.e. aspects, of a device, are most important to monitor to detect (subtypes of) Mobile Trojans. The focus of this paper is on dynamic hardware features. Using these dynamic features we apply state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and AdaBoost. We show classification results on different feature sets, making a distinction between global device features, and specific app features. None of the measured feature sets require privileged access.   Our results show that the Random Forest classifier performs best as a general malware classifier: across 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans, it achieves an F1 score of 0.73 with a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.009 and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.380. The Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and AdaBoost classifiers achieve F1 scores above 0.72, an FPR below 0.02 and, an FNR below 0.33, when trained separately to detect each subtype of Mobile Trojans.

> In this paper, Bayesian based aggregation of decision trees in an ensemble (decision forest) is investigated. The focus is laid on multi-class classification with number of samples significantly skewed toward one of the classes. The algorithm leverages out-of-bag datasets to estimate prediction errors of individual trees, which are then used in accordance with the Bayes rule to refine the decision of the ensemble. The algorithm takes prevalence of individual classes into account and does not require setting of any additional parameters related to class weights or decision-score thresholds. Evaluation is based on publicly available datasets as well as on an proprietary dataset comprising network traffic telemetry from hundreds of enterprise networks with over a million of users overall. The aim is to increase the detection capabilities of an operating malware detection system. While we were able to keep precision of the system higher than 94\%, that is only 6 out of 100 detections shown to the network administrator are false alarms, we were able to achieve increase of approximately 7\% in the number of detections. The algorithm effectively handles large amounts of data, and can be used in conjunction with most of the state-of-the-art algorithms used to train decision forests.

> Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays important role in personalized advertising and recommender systems. Though many models have been proposed such as FM, FFM and DeepFM in recent years, feature engineering is still a very important way to improve the model performance in many applications because using raw features can rarely lead to optimal results. For example, the continuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new feature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature. However, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience and it is both time consuming and labor consuming. On the other side, concise CTR model with both fast online serving speed and good model performance is critical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose LeafFM model based on FM to generate new features from the original feature embedding by learning the transformation functions automatically. We also design three concrete Leaf-FM models according to the different strategies of combing the original and the generated features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets and the results show Leaf-FM model outperforms standard FMs by a large margin. Compared with FFMs, Leaf-FM can achieve significantly better performance with much less parameters. In Avazu and Malware dataset, add version Leaf-FM achieves comparable performance with some deep learning based models such as DNN and AutoInt. As an improved FM model, Leaf-FM has the same computation complexity with FM in online serving phase and it means Leaf-FM is applicable in many industry applications because of its better performance and high computation efficiency.

> In the recent years, Portable Document Format, commonly known as PDF, has become a democratized standard for document exchange and dissemination. This trend has been due to its characteristics such as its flexibility and portability across platforms. The widespread use of PDF has installed a false impression of inherent safety among benign users. However, the characteristics of PDF motivated hackers to exploit various types of vulnerabilities, overcome security safeguards, thereby making the PDF format one of the most efficient malicious code attack vectors. Therefore, efficiently detecting malicious PDF files is crucial for information security. Several analysis techniques has been proposed in the literature, be it static or dynamic, to extract the main features that allow the discrimination of malware files from benign ones. Since classical analysis techniques may be limited in case of zero-days, machine-learning based techniques have emerged recently as an automatic PDF-malware detection method that is able to generalize from a set of training samples. These techniques are themselves facing the challenge of evasion attacks where a malicious PDF is transformed to look benign. In this work, we give an overview on the PDF-malware detection problem. We give a perspective on the new challenges and emerging solutions.

> Delivering malware covertly and evasively is critical to advanced malware campaigns. In this paper, we present a new method to covertly and evasively deliver malware through a neural network model. Neural network models are poorly explainable and have a good generalization ability. By embedding malware in neurons, the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the performance of neural network. Meanwhile, because the structure of the neural network model remains unchanged, it can pass the security scan of antivirus engines. Experiments show that 36.9MB of malware can be embedded in a 178MB-AlexNet model within 1% accuracy loss, and no suspicion is raised by anti-virus engines in VirusTotal, which verifies the feasibility of this method. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks for attacks becomes a forwarding trend. We hope this work can provide a reference scenario for the defense on neural network-assisted attacks.

> Network telescopes or "Darknets" provide a unique window into Internet-wide malicious activities associated with malware propagation, denial of service attacks, scanning performed for network reconnaissance, and others. Analyses of the resulting data can provide actionable insights to security analysts that can be used to prevent or mitigate cyber-threats. Large Darknets, however, observe millions of nefarious events on a daily basis which makes the transformation of the captured information into meaningful insights challenging. We present a novel framework for characterizing Darknet behavior and its temporal evolution aiming to address this challenge. The proposed framework: (i) Extracts a high dimensional representation of Darknet events composed of features distilled from Darknet data and other external sources; (ii) Learns, in an unsupervised fashion, an information-preserving low-dimensional representation of these events (using deep representation learning) that is amenable to clustering; (iv) Performs clustering of the scanner data in the resulting representation space and provides interpretable insights using optimal decision trees; and (v) Utilizes the clustering outcomes as "signatures" that can be used to detect structural changes in the Darknet activities. We evaluate the proposed system on a large operational Network Telescope and demonstrate its ability to detect real-world, high-impact cybersecurity incidents.

> With the rapid growth of the number of devices on the Internet, malware poses a threat not only to the affected devices but also their ability to use said devices to launch attacks on the Internet ecosystem. Rapid malware classification is an important tools to combat that threat. One of the successful approaches to classification is based on malware images and deep learning. While many deep learning architectures are very accurate they usually take a long time to train. In this work we perform experiments on multiple well known, pre-trained, deep network architectures in the context of transfer learning. We show that almost all them classify malware accurately with a very short training period.

Recent advances in deep learning has brought forth improvements in generative model architectures, and some state-of-the-art models can (in some cases) produce outputs realistic enough to fool humans.   We survey recent research at the intersection of security and privacy and generative models. In particular, we discuss the use of generative models in adversarial machine learning, in helping automate or enhance existing attacks, and as building blocks for defenses in contexts such as intrusion detection, biometrics spoofing, and malware obfuscation. We also describe the use of generative models in diverse applications such as fairness in machine learning, privacy-preserving data synthesis, and steganography. Finally, we discuss new threats due to generative models: the creation of synthetic media such as deepfakes that can be used for disinformation.

> Machine learning has been increasingly used as a first line of defense for Windows malware detection.

To this end, we present secml-malware, the first Python library for computing adversarial attacks on Windows malware detectors. \secmlmalware implements state-of-the-art white-box and black-box attacks on Windows malware classifiers, by leveraging a set of feasible manipulations that can be applied to Windows programs while preserving their functionality. The library can be used to perform the penetration testing and assessment of the adversarial robustness of Windows malware detectors, and it can be easily extended to include novel attack strategies.

> Ransomware is a growing threat to individuals and enterprises alike, constituting a major factor in cyber insurance and in the security planning of every organization. Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as a competition between equals -- a profit maximizing attacker and a loss minimizing defender -- the reality of many situations is that ransomware organizations are not playing a non-cooperative game, they are playing a lottery. The wanton behavior of attackers creates a situation where many victims are hit more than once by ransomware operators, sometimes even by the same group. If defenders wish to combat malware, they must then seek to remove the incentives of it.   In this work, we construct an expected value model based on data from actual ransomware attacks and identify three variables: the value of payments, the cost of an attack, and the probability of payment. Using this model, we consider the potential to manipulate these variables to reduce the profit motive associated with ransomware attack. Based on the model, we present mitigations to encourage an environment that is hostile to ransomware operators. In particular, we find that off-site backups and government incentives for their adoption are the most fruitful avenue for combating ransomware.

> A crucial technical challenge for cybercriminals is to keep control over the potentially millions of infected devices that build up their botnets, without compromising the robustness of their attacks. A single, fixed C&C server, for example, can be trivially detected either by binary or traffic analysis and immediately sink-holed or taken-down by security researchers or law enforcement. Botnets often use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), primarily to evade take-down attempts. DGAs can enlarge the lifespan of a malware campaign, thus potentially enhancing its profitability. They can also contribute to hindering attack accountability. In this work, we introduce HYDRAS, the most comprehensive and representative dataset of Algorithmically-Generated Domains (AGD) available to date. The dataset contains more than 100 DGA families, including both real-world and adversarially designed ones. We analyse the dataset and discuss the possibility of differentiating between benign requests (to real domains) and malicious ones (to AGDs) in real-time. The simultaneous study of so many families and variants introduces several challenges; nonetheless, it alleviates biases found in previous literature employing small datasets which are frequently overfitted, exploiting characteristic features of particular families that do not generalise well.We thoroughly compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art and highlight some methodological shortcomings in the actual state of practice. The outcomes obtained show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of both classification performance and efficiency.

> Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become a significant part of the Android ecosystem. Developers can employ various TPLs to facilitate their app development. Unfortunately, the popularity of TPLs also brings new security issues. For example, TPLs may carry malicious or vulnerable code, which can infect popular apps to pose threats to mobile users. Furthermore, TPL detection is essential for downstream tasks, such as vulnerabilities and malware detection. Thus, various tools have been developed to identify TPLs. However, no existing work has studied these TPL detection tools in detail, and different tools focus on different applications and techniques with performance differences. A comprehensive understanding of these tools will help us make better use of them. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to fill the gap by evaluating and comparing all publicly available TPL detection tools based on six criteria: accuracy of TPL construction, effectiveness, efficiency, accuracy of version identification, resiliency to code obfuscation, and ease of use. Besides, we enhance these open-source tools by fixing their limitations, to improve their detection ability. Finally, we build an extensible framework that integrates all existing available TPL detection tools, providing an online service for the research community. We release the evaluation dataset and enhanced tools. According to our study, we also present the essential findings and discuss promising implications to the community. We believe our work provides a clear picture of existing TPL detection techniques and also gives a roadmap for future research.

It allows computers to learn from experience and to understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each being defined through its relations to simpler concepts. Relying on the strong capabilities of deep learning, we propose a convolutional generative adversarial network-based (Conv-GAN) framework titled MalFox, targeting adversarial malware example generation against third-party black-box malware detectors.

Our evaluation indicates that the accuracy can be as high as 99.0% which significantly outperforms the other 12 well-known learning models.

> The detection of malware is a critical task for the protection of computing environments. This task often requires extremely low false positive rates (FPR) of 0.01% or even lower, for which modern machine learning has no readily available tools. We introduce the first broad investigation of the use of uncertainty for malware detection across multiple datasets, models, and feature types. We show how ensembling and Bayesian treatments of machine learning methods for static malware detection allow for improved identification of model errors, uncovering of new malware families, and predictive performance under extreme false positive constraints. In particular, we improve the true positive rate (TPR) at an actual realized FPR of 1e-5 from an expected 0.69 for previous methods to 0.80 on the best performing model class on the Sophos industry scale dataset. We additionally demonstrate how previous works have used an evaluation protocol that can lead to misleading results.

> Malware is a piece of software that was written with the intent of doing harm to data, devices, or people. Since a number of new malware variants can be generated by reusing codes, malware attacks can be easily launched and thus become common in recent years, incurring huge losses in businesses, governments, financial institutes, health providers, etc. To defeat these attacks, malware classification is employed, which plays an essential role in anti-virus products. However, existing works that employ either static analysis or dynamic analysis have major weaknesses in complicated reverse engineering and time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we propose a visualized malware classification framework called VisMal, which provides highly efficient categorization with acceptable accuracy. VisMal converts malware samples into images and then applies a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm to enhance the similarity between malware image regions in the same family. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation and carried out an extensive evaluation to verify the performance of our framework. The evaluation results indicate that VisMal can classify a malware sample within 5.2ms and have an average accuracy of 96.0%. Moreover, VisMal provides security engineers with a simple visualization approach to further validate its performance.

> Binary code similarity detection is a fundamental technique for many security applications such as vulnerability search, patch analysis, and malware detection. There is an increasing need to detect similar code for vulnerability search across architectures with the increase of critical vulnerabilities in IoT devices. The variety of IoT hardware architectures and software platforms requires to capture semantic equivalence of code fragments in the similarity detection. However, existing approaches are insufficient in capturing the semantic similarity. We notice that the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a function contains rich semantic information. Inspired by successful applications of natural language processing technologies in sentence semantic understanding, we propose a deep learning-based AST-encoding method, named ASTERIA, to measure the semantic equivalence of functions in different platforms. Our method leverages the Tree-LSTM network to learn the semantic representation of a function from its AST. Then the similarity detection can be conducted efficiently and accurately by measuring the similarity between two representation vectors. We have implemented an open-source prototype of ASTERIA. The Tree-LSTM model is trained on a dataset with 1,022,616 function pairs and evaluated on a dataset with 95,078 function pairs. Evaluation results show that our method outperforms the AST-based tool Diaphora and the-state-of-art method Gemini by large margins with respect to the binary similarity detection. And our method is several orders of magnitude faster than Diaphora and Gemini for the similarity calculation. In the application of vulnerability search, our tool successfully identified 75 vulnerable functions in 5,979 IoT firmware images.

> Privileged malware neutralizes software-based versioning systems and destroys data. To counter this threat, a versioning solid-state drive (SSD) that performs versioning inside the SSD has been studied. An SSD is a suitable candidate for data versioning because it can preserve previous versions without additional copying, and provide high security with a very small trusted computing base (TCB). However, the versioning SSDs studied so far commonly use a full disk versioning method that preserves all file versions in a batch. This paper demonstrates that SSDs, which provide full disk versioning, can be exposed to data tampering attacks when the retention time of data is less than the malware's dwell time. To deal with this threat, we propose SGX-SSD, a policy-based per-file versioning SSD to keep a deeper history for only the important files of users. However, since the SSD isn't aware of a file semantic, and the versioning policy information should be securely received from the untrusted host computer, implementing the per-file versioning in SSD is a huge challenge. To solve this problem, SGX-SSD utilizes the Intel SGX and has a secure host interface to securely receive policy information (configuration values) from the user. Also, to solve the file semantic unawareness problem of the SSD, a piggyback module is designed to give a file hint at the host layer, and an algorithm for selective versioning based on the policy is implemented in the SSD. To prove our system, we prototyped SGX-SSD the Jasmine OpenSSD platform in Linux environment. In the experimental evaluation, we proved that SGX-SSD provides strong security with little additional overhead for selective per-file versioning.

> Android is undergoing unprecedented malicious threats daily, but the existing methods for malware detection often fail to cope with evolving camouflage in malware. To address this issue, we present HAWK, a new malware detection framework for evolutionary Android applications. We model Android entities and behavioural relationships as a heterogeneous information network (HIN), exploiting its rich semantic metastructures for specifying implicit higher-order relationships. An incremental learning model is created to handle the applications that manifest dynamically, without the need for re-constructing the whole HIN and the subsequent embedding model. The model can pinpoint rapidly the proximity between a new application and existing in-sample applications and aggregate their numerical embeddings under various semantics. Our experiments examine more than 80,860 malicious and 100,375 benign applications developed over a period of seven years, showing that HAWK achieves the highest detection accuracy against baselines and takes only 3.5ms on average to detect an out-of-sample application, with the accelerated training time of 50x faster than the existing approach.

Results indicate that the approach scales. Moreover, we investigate the discrepancies and show that the approach can reach a very low false-positive rate, 0.3%, but at a particular cost, e.g., removing 90% of sensitive methods.

> With the growing pace of using machine learning to solve various problems, securing these models against adversaries has become one of the main concerns of researchers. Recent studies have shown that in an adversarial environment, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversaries can create carefully crafted inputs to fool the models. With the advent of deep neural networks, many researchers have used deep neural networks for various tasks, and have achieved impressive results. These models must become robust against attacks before being deployed safely, especially in security-related fields such as malware detection. In this paper, we first present a black-box source code-based adversarial malware generation approach that can be used to evaluate the robustness of malware detection models against real-world adversaries. The proposed approach injects adversarial codes into the various locations of malware source codes to evade malware detection models. We then propose Mal2GCN, a robust malware detection model. Mal2GCN uses the representation power of graph convolutional networks combined with the non-negative weights training method to create a malware detection model with high detection accuracy, which is also robust against adversarial attacks that add benign features to the input.

> URLs are central to a myriad of cyber-security threats, from phishing to the distribution of malware. Their inherent ease of use and familiarity is continuously abused by attackers to evade defences and deceive end-users. Seemingly dissimilar URLs are being used in an organized way to perform phishing attacks and distribute malware. We refer to such behaviours as campaigns, with the hypothesis being that attacks are often coordinated to maximize success rates and develop evasion tactics. The aim is to gain better insights into campaigns, bolster our grasp of their characteristics, and thus aid the community devise more robust solutions. To this end, we performed extensive research and analysis into 311M records containing 77M unique real-world URLs that were submitted to VirusTotal from Dec 2019 to Jan 2020. From this dataset, 2.6M suspicious campaigns were identified based on their attached metadata, of which 77,810 were doubly verified as malicious. Using the 38.1M records and 9.9M URLs within these malicious campaigns, we provide varied insights such as their targeted victim brands as well as URL sizes and heterogeneity. Some surprising findings were observed, such as detection rates falling to just 13.27% for campaigns that employ more than 100 unique URLs. The paper concludes with several case-studies that illustrate the common malicious techniques employed by attackers to imperil users and circumvent defences.

> The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is paralleled by them being on the front-line of malicious attacks. This has led to an explosion in the number of IoT malware, with continued mutations, evolution, and sophistication. These malicious software are detected using machine learning (ML) algorithms alongside the traditional signature-based methods. Although ML-based detectors improve the detection performance, they are susceptible to malware evolution and sophistication, making them limited to the patterns that they have been trained upon. This continuous trend motivates the large body of literature on malware analysis and detection research, with many systems emerging constantly, and outperforming their predecessors. In this work, we systematically examine the state-of-the-art malware detection approaches, that utilize various representation and learning techniques, under a range of adversarial settings. Our analyses highlight the instability of the proposed detectors in learning patterns that distinguish the benign from the malicious software. The results exhibit that software mutations with functionality-preserving operations, such as stripping and padding, significantly deteriorate the accuracy of such detectors. Additionally, our analysis of the industry-standard malware detectors shows their instability to the malware mutations.

> Malicious software (malware) is a major cyber threat that has to be tackled with Machine Learning (ML) techniques because millions of new malware examples are injected into cyberspace on a daily basis. However, ML is vulnerable to attacks known as adversarial examples. In this paper, we survey and systematize the field of Adversarial Malware Detection (AMD) through the lens of a unified conceptual framework of assumptions, attacks, defenses, and security properties. This not only leads us to map attacks and defenses to partial order structures, but also allows us to clearly describe the attack-defense arms race in the AMD context. We draw a number of insights, including: knowing the defender's feature set is critical to the success of transfer attacks; the effectiveness of practical evasion attacks largely depends on the attacker's freedom in conducting manipulations in the problem space; knowing the attacker's manipulation set is critical to the defender's success; the effectiveness of adversarial training depends on the defender's capability in identifying the most powerful attack. We also discuss a number of future research directions.

> Hardware wallets are designed to withstand malware attacks by isolating their private keys from the cyberspace, but they are vulnerable to the attacks that fake an address stored in a clipboard. To prevent such attacks, a hardware wallet asks the user to verify the recipient address shown on the wallet display. Since crypto addresses are long sequences of random symbols, their manual verification becomes a difficult task. Consequently, many users of hardware wallets elect to verify only a few symbols in the address, and this can be exploited by an attacker. In this work, we introduce EthClipper, an attack that targets owners of hardware wallets on the Ethereum platform. EthClipper malware queries a distributed database of pre-mined accounts in order to select the address with maximum visual similarity to the original one. We design and implement a EthClipper malware, which we test on Trezor, Ledger, and KeepKey wallets. To deliver computation and storage resources for the attack, we implement a distributed service, ClipperCloud, and test it on different deployment environments. Our evaluation shows that with off-the-shelf PCs and NAS storage, an attacker would be able to mine a database capable of matching 25% of the digits in an address to achieve a 50% chance of finding a fitting fake address. For responsible disclosure, we have contacted the manufactures of the hardware wallets used in the attack evaluation, and they all confirm the danger of EthClipper.

First, we perform an exploratory data analysis of the collected cyber threats. We investigate the most targeted countries, most common malwares and the distribution of attacks frequency by localisation. Second, we extract attacks' spreading patterns at country level. We model these behaviors using transition graphs decorated with probabilities of switching from a country to another. Finally, we analyse the extent to which cyber threats have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and sanitary measures imposed by governments to prevent the virus from spreading.

MalONT2.0 allows researchers to extensively capture all requisite classes and relations that gather semantic and syntactic characteristics of an android malware attack. This ontology forms the basis for the malware threat intelligence knowledge graph, MalKG, which we exemplify using three different, non-overlapping demonstrations. Malware features have been extracted from CTI reports on android threat intelligence shared on the Internet and written in the form of unstructured text. Some of these sources are blogs, threat intelligence reports, tweets, and news articles. The smallest unit of information that captures malware features is written as triples comprising head and tail entities, each connected with a relation.

> Banking Trojans came a long way in the past decade, and the recent case of Emotet showed their enduring relevance. The evolution of the modern computing landscape can be traced through Emotet and Zeus, both representative examples from the end of the past decade. As an example of earlier malware, Zeus only needed to employ simple anti-analysis techniques to stay undetected, while the more recent Emotet had to constantly evolve to stay a step ahead. Current host-based antimalware solutions face an increasing number of obstacles to perform their function. A multi-layer approach to network security is necessary for network-based intrusion response systems to secure modern networks of heterogeneous devices. A system based on a combination of a graphical network security model and a game theoretic model of cyber attacks was tested on a testbed with Windows machines infected with Trojans, experimental results showed that the proposed system effectively blocked Trojans network communications effectively preventing data leakage and yielding encouraging results for future work.

> Computer vision has witnessed several advances in recent years, with unprecedented performance provided by deep representation learning research. Image formats thus appear attractive to other fields such as malware detection, where deep learning on images alleviates the need for comprehensively hand-crafted features generalising to different malware variants. We postulate that this research direction could become the next frontier in Android malware detection, and therefore requires a clear roadmap to ensure that new approaches indeed bring novel contributions. We contribute with a first building block by developing and assessing a baseline pipeline for image-based malware detection with straightforward steps. We propose DexRay, which converts the bytecode of the app DEX files into grey-scale "vector" images and feeds them to a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. We view DexRay as foundational due to the exceedingly basic nature of the design choices, allowing to infer what could be a minimal performance that can be obtained with image-based learning in malware detection. The performance of DexRay evaluated on over 158k apps demonstrates that, while simple, our approach is effective with a high detection rate(F1-score= 0.96). Finally, we investigate the impact of time decay and image-resizing on the performance of DexRay and assess its resilience to obfuscation. This work-in-progress paper contributes to the domain of Deep Learning based Malware detection by providing a sound, simple, yet effective approach (with available artefacts) that can be the basis to scope the many profound questions that will need to be investigated to fully develop this domain.

> Online malware scanners are one of the best weapons in the arsenal of cybersecurity companies and researchers. A fundamental part of such systems is the sandbox that provides an instrumented and isolated environment (virtualized or emulated) for any user to upload and run unknown artifacts and identify potentially malicious behaviors. The provided API and the wealth of information inthe reports produced by these services have also helped attackers test the efficacy of numerous techniques to make malware hard to detect.The most common technique used by malware for evading the analysis system is to monitor the execution environment, detect the presence of any debugging artifacts, and hide its malicious behavior if needed. This is usually achieved by looking for signals suggesting that the execution environment does not belong to a the native machine, such as specific memory patterns or behavioral traits of certain CPU instructions.   In this paper, we show how an attacker can evade detection on such online services by incorporating a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm into a malware sample. Specifically, we leverage the asymptotic behavior of the computational cost of PoW algorithms when they run on some classes of hardware platforms to effectively detect a non bare-metal environment of the malware sandbox analyzer. To prove the validity of this intuition, we design and implement the POW-HOW framework, a tool to automatically implement sandbox detection strategies and embed a test evasion program into an arbitrary malware sample. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed evasion technique is durable, hard to fingerprint, and reduces existing malware detection rate by a factor of 10. Moreover, we show how bare-metal environments cannot scale with actual malware submissions rates for consumer services.

> Internet of Things devices have seen a rapid growth and popularity in recent years with many more ordinary devices gaining network capability and becoming part of the ever growing IoT network. With this exponential growth and the limitation of resources, it is becoming increasingly harder to protect against security threats such as malware due to its evolving faster than the defence mechanisms can handle with. The traditional security systems are not able to detect unknown malware as they use signature-based methods. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by introducing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis approach using neural network and binary visualisation. The prime motivation of the proposed approach is to faster detect and classify new malware (zero-day malware). The experiment results show that our method can satisfy the accuracy requirement of practical application.

> Malware abuses TLS to encrypt its malicious traffic, preventing examination by content signatures and deep packet inspection. Network detection of malicious TLS flows is an important, but challenging, problem. Prior works have proposed supervised machine learning detectors using TLS features. However, by trying to represent all malicious traffic, supervised binary detectors produce models that are too loose, thus introducing errors. Furthermore, they do not distinguish flows generated by different malware. On the other hand, supervised multi-class detectors produce tighter models and can classify flows by malware family, but require family labels, which are not available for many samples. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel unsupervised approach to detect and cluster malicious TLS flows. Our approach takes as input network traces from sandboxes. It clusters similar TLS flows using 90 features that capture properties of the TLS client, TLS server, certificate, and encrypted payload; and uses the clusters to build an unsupervised detector that can assign a malicious flow to the cluster it belongs to, or determine it is benign. We evaluate our approach using 972K traces from a commercial sandbox and 35M TLS flows from a research network. Our unsupervised detector achieves a F1 score of 0.91, compared to 0.82 for the state-of-the-art supervised detector. The false detection rate of our detector is 0.032% measured over four months of traffic.

> The generalization of deep learning has helped us, in the past, address challenges such as malware identification and anomaly detection in the network security domain. However, as effective as it is, scarcity of memory and processing power makes it difficult to perform these tasks in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This research finds an easy way out of this bottleneck by depreciating the need for feature engineering and subsequent processing in machine learning techniques. In this study, we introduce a Featureless machine learning process to perform anomaly detection. It uses unprocessed byte streams of packets as training data. Featureless machine learning enables a low cost and low memory time-series analysis of network traffic. It benefits from eliminating the significant investment in subject matter experts and the time required for feature engineering.

> New types of malware are emerging at concerning rates. However, analyzing malware via reverse engineering is still a time-consuming and mostly manual task. For this reason, it is necessary to develop techniques that automate parts of the reverse engineering process and that can evade the built-in countermeasures of modern malware. The main contribution of this paper is a novel method to automatically find so-called Points-of-Interest (POIs) in executed programs. POIs are instructions that interact with data that is known to an analyst. They can be used as beacons in the analysis of malware and can help to guide the analyst to the interesting parts of the malware. Furthermore, we propose a metric for POIs , the so-called confidence score that estimates how exclusively a POI will process data relevant to the malware. With the goal of automatically extract peers in P2P botnet malware, we demonstrate and evaluate our approach by applying it on four botnets (ZeroAccess, Sality, Nugache, and Kelihos). We looked into the identified POIs for known IPs and ports and, by using this information, leverage it to successfully monitor the botnets. Furthermore, using our scoring system, we show that we can extract peers for each botnet with high accuracy.

> While artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in various areas, it is also being used maliciously. It is necessary to study and predict AI-powered attacks to prevent them in advance. Turning neural network models into stegomalware is a malicious use of AI, which utilizes the features of neural network models to hide malware while maintaining the performance of the models. However, the existing methods have a low malware embedding rate and a high impact on the model performance, making it not practical. Therefore, by analyzing the composition of the neural network models, this paper proposes new methods to embed malware in models with high capacity and no service quality degradation. We used 19 malware samples and 10 mainstream models to build 550 malware-embedded models and analyzed the models' performance on ImageNet dataset. A new evaluation method that combines the embedding rate, the model performance impact and the embedding effort is proposed to evaluate the existing methods. This paper also designs a trigger and proposes an application scenario in attack tasks combining EvilModel with WannaCry. This paper further studies the relationship between neural network models' embedding capacity and the model structure, layer and size. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks for attacks is becoming a forwarding trend. We hope this work can provide a reference scenario for the defense of neural network-assisted attacks.

> Supervised Deep Learning requires plenty of labeled data to converge, and hence perform optimally for task-specific learning. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism named DRo (for Deep Routing) for data-scarce domains like security. The DRo approach builds upon some of the recent developments in Deep-Clustering. In particular, it exploits the self-augmented training mechanism using synthetically generated local perturbations. DRo not only allays the challenges with sparse-labeled data but also offers many unique advantages. We also developed a system named DRoID that uses the DRo mechanism for enhancing the performance of an existing Malware Detection System that uses (low information features like the) Android implicit Intent(s) as the only features. We conduct experiments on DRoID using a popular and standardized Android malware dataset and found that the DRo mechanism could successfully reduce the false-alarms generated by the downstream classifier by 67.9%, and also simultaneously boosts its accuracy by 11.3%. This is significant not only because the gains achieved are unparalleled but also because the features used were never considered rich enough to train a classifier on; and hence no decent performance could ever be reported by any malware classification system till-date using these features in isolation. Owing to the results achieved, the DRo mechanism claims a dominant position amongst all known systems that aims to enhance the classification performance of deep learning models with sparse-labeled data.

> Malware and other suspicious software often hide behaviors and components behind logic bombs and context-sensitive execution paths. Uncovering these is essential to react against modern threats, but current solutions are not ready to detect these paths in a completely automated manner. To bridge this gap, we propose the Malware Multiverse (MalVerse), a solution able to inspect multiple execution paths via symbolic execution aiming to discover function inputs and returns that trigger malicious behaviors. MalVerse automatically patches the context-sensitive functions with the identified symbolic values to allow the software execution in a traditional sandbox. We implemented MalVerse on top of angr and evaluated it with a set of Linux and Windows evasive samples. We found that MalVerse was able to generate automatic patches for the most common evasion techniques (e.g., ptrace checks).

> The Android mining sandbox approach consists in running dynamic analysis tools on a benign version of an Android app and recording every call to sensitive APIs. Later, one can use this information to (a) prevent calls to other sensitive APIs (those not previously recorded) or (b) run the dynamic analysis tools again in a different version of the app -- in order to identify possible malicious behavior. Although the use of dynamic analysis for mining Android sandboxes has been empirically investigated before, little is known about the potential benefits of combining static analysis with the mining sandbox approach for identifying malicious behavior. As such, in this paper we present the results of two empirical studies: The first is a non-exact replication of a previous research work from Bao et al., which compares the performance of test case generation tools for mining Android sandboxes. The second is a new experiment to investigate the implications of using taint analysis algorithms to complement the mining sandbox approach in the task to identify malicious behavior. Our study brings several findings. For instance, the first study reveals that a static analysis component of DroidFax (a tool used for instrumenting Android apps in the Bao et al. study) contributes substantially to the performance of the dynamic analysis tools explored in the previous work. The results of the second study show that taint analysis is also practical to complement the mining sandboxes approach, improve the performance of the later strategy in at most 28.57%.

> Cybersecurity is essential, and attacks are rapidly growing and getting more challenging to detect. The traditional Firewall and Intrusion Detection system, even though it is widely used and recommended but it fails to detect new attacks, zero-day attacks, and traffic patterns that do not match with any configured rules. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) can be an efficient and cost-reduced solution in cybersecurity.   We used Netflow datasets to extract features after applying data analysis. Then, a selection process has been applied to compare these features with one another. Our experiments focus on how efficient machine learning algorithms can detect Bot traffic, Malware traffic, and background traffic. We managed to get 0.903 precision value from a dataset that has 6.5% Bot flows, 1.57% Normal flows, 0.18% Command&Control (C&C) flows, and 91.7% background flows, from 2,753,884 total flows. The results show low false-negative with few false-positive detections.

> Many recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly stronger than local robustness.   In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster increases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.   We show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate, compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.

> Ransomware is a growing threat to individuals and enterprises alike, constituting a major factor in cyber insurance and in the security planning of every organization. Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as a competition between equals -- a profit maximizing attacker and a loss minimizing defender -- the reality of many situations is that ransomware organizations are not playing a non-cooperative game, they are playing a lottery. The wanton behavior of attackers creates a situation where many victims are hit more than once by ransomware operators, sometimes even by the same group. If defenders wish to combat malware, they must then seek to remove the incentives of it.   In this work, we construct an expected value model based on data from actual ransomware attacks and identify three variables: the value of payments, the cost of an attack, and the probability of payment. Using this model, we consider the potential to manipulate these variables to reduce the profit motive associated with ransomware attack. Based on the model, we present mitigations to encourage an environment that is hostile to ransomware operators. In particular, we find that off-site backups and government incentives for their adoption are the most fruitful avenue for combating ransomware.

> Digital investigators often get involved with cases, which seemingly point the responsibility to the person to which the computer belongs, but after a thorough examination malware is proven to be the cause, causing loss of precious time. Whilst Anti-Virus (AV) software can assist the investigator in identifying the presence of malware, with the increase in zero-day attacks and errors that exist in AV tools, this is something that cannot be relied upon. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of malware upon various Windows operating system versions in order to determine and correlate the relationship between malicious software and OS artifacts. This will enable an investigator to be more efficient in identifying the presence of new malware and provide a starting point for further investigation.

> The deep learning approach to detecting malicious software (malware) is promising but has yet to tackle the problem of dataset shift, namely that the joint distribution of examples and their labels associated with the test set is different from that of the training set. This problem causes the degradation of deep learning models without users' notice. In order to alleviate the problem, one approach is to let a classifier not only predict the label on a given example but also present its uncertainty (or confidence) on the predicted label, whereby a defender can decide whether to use the predicted label or not. While intuitive and clearly important, the capabilities and limitations of this approach have not been well understood. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the quality of predictive uncertainties of malware detectors. Specifically, we re-design and build 24 Android malware detectors (by transforming four off-the-shelf detectors with six calibration methods) and quantify their uncertainties with nine metrics, including three metrics dealing with data imbalance. Our main findings are: (i) predictive uncertainty indeed helps achieve reliable malware detection in the presence of dataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (ii) approximate Bayesian methods are promising to calibrate and generalize malware detectors to deal with dataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (iii) adversarial evasion attacks can render calibration methods useless, and it is an open problem to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted labels of adversarial examples (i.e., it is not effective to use predictive uncertainty to detect adversarial examples).

- `2109.10417v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10417v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10417v1)

> With the rapid development of machine learning for image classification, researchers have found new applications of visualization techniques in malware detection. By converting binary code into images, researchers have shown satisfactory results in applying machine learning to extract features that are difficult to discover manually. Such visualization-based malware detection methods can capture malware patterns from many different malware families and improve malware detection speed. On the other hand, recent research has also shown adversarial attacks against such visualization-based malware detection. Attackers can generate adversarial examples by perturbing the malware binary in non-reachable regions, such as padding at the end of the binary. Alternatively, attackers can perturb the malware image embedding and then verify the executability of the malware post-transformation. One major limitation of the first attack scenario is that a simple pre-processing step can remove the perturbations before classification. For the second attack scenario, it is hard to maintain the original malware's executability and functionality. In this work, we provide literature review on existing malware visualization techniques and attacks against them. We summarize the limitation of the previous work, and design a new adversarial example attack against visualization-based malware detection that can evade pre-processing filtering and maintain the original malware functionality. We test our attack on a public malware dataset and achieve a 98% success rate.

> The ability to transfer adversarial attacks from one model (the surrogate) to another model (the victim) has been an issue of concern within the machine learning (ML) community. The ability to successfully evade unseen models represents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks. In this work we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an unrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same training data as the victim. We present the first study of transferring adversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under imperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable level of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each model. This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and others. Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with data or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset. This makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other and contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security. We remedy this by developing a masked version of Projected Gradient Descent that simulates class disparity, which enables the attacker to reliably estimate a lower-bound on their attack's success.

> In some problem spaces, the high cost of obtaining ground truth labels necessitates use of lower quality reference datasets. It is difficult to benchmark model performance using these datasets, as evaluation results may be biased. We propose a supplement to using reference labels, which we call an approximate ground truth refinement (AGTR). Using an AGTR, we prove that bounds on specific metrics used to evaluate clustering algorithms and multi-class classifiers can be computed without reference labels. We also introduce a procedure that uses an AGTR to identify inaccurate evaluation results produced from datasets of dubious quality. Creating an AGTR requires domain knowledge, and malware family classification is a task with robust domain knowledge approaches that support the construction of an AGTR. We demonstrate our AGTR evaluation framework by applying it to a popular malware labeling tool to diagnose over-fitting in prior testing and evaluate changes whose impact could not be meaningfully quantified under previous data.

> Advanced metamorphic malware and ransomware, by using obfuscation, could alter their internal structure with every attack. If such malware could intrude even into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original malware instance gets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. It is challenging to obtain training data for such evasive malware. Therefore, in this paper, we present ADVERSARIALuscator, a novel system that uses specialized Adversarial-DRL to obfuscate malware at the opcode level and create multiple metamorphic instances of the same. To the best of our knowledge, ADVERSARIALuscator is the first-ever system that adopts the Markov Decision Process-based approach to convert and find a solution to the problem of creating individual obfuscations at the opcode level. This is important as the machine language level is the least at which functionality could be preserved so as to mimic an actual attack effectively. ADVERSARIALuscator is also the first-ever system to use efficient continuous action control capable of deep reinforcement learning agents like the Proximal Policy Optimization in the area of cyber security. Experimental results indicate that ADVERSARIALuscator could raise the metamorphic probability of a corpus of malware by >0.45. Additionally, more than 33% of metamorphic instances generated by ADVERSARIALuscator were able to evade the most potent IDS. If such malware could intrude even into any of the IoT networks, then even if the original malware instance gets detected, by that time it can still infect the entire network. Hence ADVERSARIALuscator could be used to generate data representative of a swarm of very potent and coordinated AI-based metamorphic malware attacks. The so generated data and simulations could be used to bolster the defenses of an IDS against an actual AI-based metamorphic attack from advanced malware and ransomware.

> Anti-malware agents typically communicate with their remote services to share information about suspicious files. These remote services use their up-to-date information and global context (view) to help classify the files and instruct their agents to take a predetermined action (e.g., delete or quarantine). In this study, we provide a security analysis of a specific form of communication between anti-malware agents and their services, which takes place entirely over the insecure DNS protocol. These services, which we denote DNS anti-malware list (DNSAML) services, affect the classification of files scanned by anti-malware agents, therefore potentially putting their consumers at risk due to known integrity and confidentiality flaws of the DNS protocol. By analyzing a large-scale DNS traffic dataset made available to the authors by a well-known CDN provider, we identify anti-malware solutions that seem to make use of DNSAML services. We found that these solutions, deployed on almost three million machines worldwide, exchange hundreds of millions of DNS requests daily. These requests are carrying sensitive file scan information, oftentimes - as we demonstrate - without any additional safeguards to compensate for the insecurities of the DNS protocol. As a result, these anti-malware solutions that use DNSAML are made vulnerable to DNS attacks. For instance, an attacker capable of tampering with DNS queries, gains the ability to alter the classification of scanned files, without presence on the scanning machine. We showcase three attacks applicable to at least three anti-malware solutions that could result in the disclosure of sensitive information and improper behavior of the anti-malware agent, such as ignoring detected threats. Finally, we propose and review a set of countermeasures for anti-malware solution providers to prevent the attacks stemming from the use of DNSAML services.

> Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks have shown great promise in artificial intelligence (AI) based language modeling. Recently, LSTM networks have also become popular for designing AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). However, its applicability in IDS is studied largely in the default settings as used in language models. Whereas security applications offer distinct conditions and hence warrant careful consideration while applying such recurrent networks. Therefore, we conducted one of the most exhaustive works on LSTM hyper-parameters for IDS and experimented with approx. 150 LSTM configurations to determine its hyper-parameters relative importance, interaction effects, and optimal selection approach for designing an IDS. We conducted multiple analyses of the results of these experiments and empirically controlled for the interaction effects of different hyper-parameters covariate levels. We found that for security applications, especially for designing an IDS, neither similar relative importance as applicable to language models is valid, nor is the standard linear method for hyper-parameter selection ideal. We ascertained that the interaction effect plays a crucial role in determining the relative importance of hyper-parameters. We also discovered that after controlling for the interaction effect, the correct relative importance for LSTMs for an IDS is batch-size, followed by dropout ratio and padding. The findings are significant because when LSTM was first used for language models, the focus had mostly been on increasing the number of layers to enhance performance.

> In cybersecurity, attackers range from brash, unsophisticated script kiddies and cybercriminals to stealthy, patient advanced persistent threats. When modeling these attackers, we can observe that they demonstrate different risk-seeking and risk-averse behaviors. This work explores how an attacker's risk seeking or risk averse behavior affects their operations against detection-optimizing defenders in an Internet of Things ecosystem. Using an evaluation framework which uses real, parametrizable malware, we develop a game that is played by a defender against attackers with a suite of malware that is parameterized to be more aggressive and more stealthy. These results are evaluated under a framework of exponential utility according to their willingness to accept risk. We find that against a defender who must choose a single strategy up front, risk-seeking attackers gain more actual utility than risk-averse attackers, particularly in cases where the defender is better equipped than the two attackers anticipate. Additionally, we empirically confirm that high-risk, high-reward scenarios are more beneficial to risk-seeking attackers like cybercriminals, while low-risk, low-reward scenarios are more beneficial to risk-averse attackers like advanced persistent threats.

> Exploits constitute malware in the form of application inputs. They take advantage of security vulnerabilities inside programs in order to yield execution control to attackers. The root cause of successful exploitation lies in emergent functionality introduced when programs are compiled and loaded in memory for execution, called `Weird Machines' (WMs). Essentially WMs are unexpected virtual machines that execute attackers' bytecode, complicating malware analysis whenever the bytecode set is unknown. We take the direction that WM bytecode is best understood at the level of the process memory layout attained by exploit execution. Each step building towards this memory layout comprises an exploit primitive, an exploit's basic building block. This work presents a WM reconstruction algorithm that works by identifying pre-defined exploit primitive-related behaviour during the dynamic analysis of target binaries, associating it with the responsible exploit segment - the WM bytecode. In this manner any analyst familiar with exploit programming will immediately recognise the reconstructed WM bytecode's semantics. This work is a first attempt at studying the feasibility of this method and focuses on web browsers when targeted by JavaScript exploits.

> The development of machine learning algorithms in the cyber security domain has been impeded by the complex, hierarchical, sequential and multimodal nature of the data involved. In this paper we introduce the notion of a streaming tree as a generic data structure encompassing a large portion of real-world cyber security data. Starting from host-based event logs we represent computer processes as streaming trees that evolve in continuous time. Leveraging the properties of the signature kernel, a machine learning tool that recently emerged as a leading technology for learning with complex sequences of data, we develop the SK-Tree algorithm. SK-Tree is a supervised learning method for systematic malware detection on streaming trees that is robust to irregular sampling and high dimensionality of the underlying streams. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SK-Tree to detect malicious events on a portion of the publicly available DARPA OpTC dataset, achieving an AUROC score of 98%.

> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are among the most widespread computing technologies with technical potential and profitable opportunities in numerous applications worldwide. Further, RFID is the core technology behind the Internet of Things (IoT), which can accomplish the real-time transmission of information between objects without manual operation. However, RFID security has been taken for granted for several years, causing multiple vulnerabilities that can even damage human functionalities. The latest ISO/IEC 18000-63:2015 standard concerning RFID dates to 2015, and much freedom has been given to manufacturers responsible for making their devices secure. The lack of a substantial standard for devices that implement RFID technology creates many vulnerabilities that expose end-users to elevated risk. Hence, this paper gives the reader a clear overview of the technology, and it analyzes 23 well-known RFID attacks such as Reverse Engineering, Buffer Overflow, Eavesdropping, and Malware. Moreover, given the exceptional capabilities and utilities of RFID devices, this paper has focused on security measures and defenses for protecting them, such as Active Jamming, Shielding tag, and Authentication.

> Online malware scanners are one of the best weapons in the arsenal of cybersecurity companies and researchers. A fundamental part of such systems is the sandbox that provides an instrumented and isolated environment (virtualized or emulated) for any user to upload and run unknown artifacts and identify potentially malicious behaviors. The provided API and the wealth of information inthe reports produced by these services have also helped attackers test the efficacy of numerous techniques to make malware hard to detect.The most common technique used by malware for evading the analysis system is to monitor the execution environment, detect the presence of any debugging artifacts, and hide its malicious behavior if needed. This is usually achieved by looking for signals suggesting that the execution environment does not belong to a the native machine, such as specific memory patterns or behavioral traits of certain CPU instructions.   In this paper, we show how an attacker can evade detection on such online services by incorporating a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm into a malware sample. Specifically, we leverage the asymptotic behavior of the computational cost of PoW algorithms when they run on some classes of hardware platforms to effectively detect a non bare-metal environment of the malware sandbox analyzer. To prove the validity of this intuition, we design and implement the POW-HOW framework, a tool to automatically implement sandbox detection strategies and embed a test evasion program into an arbitrary malware sample. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed evasion technique is durable, hard to fingerprint, and reduces existing malware detection rate by a factor of 10. Moreover, we show how bare-metal environments cannot scale with actual malware submissions rates for consumer services.

To detect and prevent the malware distribution in the victim machine, the existing end device security applications may leverage techniques such as signature or anomaly-based, machine learning techniques. The well-known file formats Portable Executable (PE) for Windows and Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) for Linux based operating system are used for malware analysis, and the malware detection capabilities of these files has been well advanced for real-time detection. But the malware payload hiding in multimedia using steganography detection has been a challenge for enterprises, as these are rarely seen and usually act as a stager in sophisticated attacks. In this article, to our knowledge, we are the first to try to address the knowledge gap between the current progress in image steganography and steganalysis academic research focusing on data hiding and the review of the stegomalware (malware payload hiding in images) targeting enterprises with cyberattacks current status. We present the stegomalware history, generation tools, file format specification description. Based on our findings, we perform the detail review of the image steganography techniques including the recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based models and the image steganalysis methods including the Deep Learning(DL) models for hiding data detection. Additionally, the stegomalware detection framework for enterprise is proposed for anomaly based stegomalware detection emphasizing the architecture details for different network environments. Finally, the research opportunities and challenges in stegomalware generation and detection are also presented.

- *Hamid Bostani, Veelasha Moonsamy*

- `2110.03301v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03301v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03301v1)

> Over the last decade, several studies have investigated the weaknesses of Android malware detectors against adversarial examples by proposing novel evasion attacks; however, the practicality of most studies in manipulating real-world malware is arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in real life, malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper presents a practical evasion attack, EvadeDroid, to circumvent black-box Android malware detectors. In addition to generating real-world adversarial malware, the proposed evasion attack can preserve the functionality of the original malware samples. EvadeDroid applies a set of functionality-preserving transformations to morph malware instances into benign ones using an iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a novel, query-efficient optimization algorithm with the aim of finding and injecting optimal sequences of transformations into malware samples. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of EvadeDroid under hard- and soft-label attacks. Moreover, EvadeDroid is capable to generate practical adversarial examples with only a small number of queries, with evasion rate of 81%, 73%, and 75% for DREBIN, Sec-SVM, and MaMaDroid, respectively. Finally, we show that EvadeDroid is able to preserve its stealthiness against four popular commercial antivirus, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.

> The goal of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) detection is to recognize infections with bot malware and is often done with help of Machine Learning approaches that classify non-resolving Domain Name System (DNS) traffic and are trained on possibly sensitive data. In parallel, the rise of privacy research in the Machine Learning world leads to privacy-preserving measures that are tightly coupled with a deep learning model's architecture or training routine, while non deep learning approaches are commonly better suited for the application of privacy-enhancing methods outside the actual classification module. In this work, we aim to measure the privacy capability of the feature extractor of feature-based DGA detector FANCI (Feature-based Automated Nxdomain Classification and Intelligence). Our goal is to assess whether a data-rich adversary can learn an inverse mapping of FANCI's feature extractor and thereby reconstruct domain names from feature vectors. Attack success would pose a privacy threat to sharing FANCI's feature representation, while the opposite would enable this representation to be shared without privacy concerns. Using three real-world data sets, we train a recurrent Machine Learning model on the reconstruction task. Our approaches result in poor reconstruction performance and we attempt to back our findings with a mathematical review of the feature extraction process. We thus reckon that sharing FANCI's feature representation does not constitute a considerable privacy leakage.

- *Rui Shu, Tianpei Xia, Laurie Williams, Tim Menzies*

- `2011.12720v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12720v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12720v2)

> Background: Machine learning-based security detection models have become prevalent in modern malware and intrusion detection systems. However, previous studies show that such models are susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks. In this type of attack, inputs (i.e., adversarial examples) are specially crafted by intelligent malicious adversaries, with the aim of being misclassified by existing state-of-the-art models (e.g., deep neural networks). Once the attackers can fool a classifier to think that a malicious input is actually benign, they can render a machine learning-based malware or intrusion detection system ineffective. Goal: To help security practitioners and researchers build a more robust model against non-adaptive, white-box, and non-targeted adversarial evasion attacks through the idea of an ensemble model. Method: We propose an approach called Omni, the main idea of which is to explore methods that create an ensemble of "unexpected models"; i.e., models whose control hyperparameters have a large distance to the hyperparameters of an adversary's target model, with which we then make an optimized weighted ensemble prediction. Result: In studies with five types of adversarial evasion attacks (FGSM, BIM, JSMA, DeepFooland Carlini-Wagner) on five security datasets (NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICAnd-Mal2017, and the Contagio PDF dataset), we show Omni is a promising approach as a defense strategy against adversarial attacks when compared with other baseline treatments. Conclusion: When employing ensemble defense against adversarial evasion attacks, we suggest creating an ensemble with unexpected models that are distant from the attacker's expected model (i.e., target model) through methods such as hyperparameter optimization.

> In adversarial machine learning, new defenses against attacks on deep learning systems are routinely broken soon after their release by more powerful attacks. In this context, forensic tools can offer a valuable complement to existing defenses, by tracing back a successful attack to its root cause, and offering a path forward for mitigation to prevent similar attacks in the future.   In this paper, we describe our efforts in developing a forensic traceback tool for poison attacks on deep neural networks. We propose a novel iterative clustering and pruning solution that trims "innocent" training samples, until all that remains is the set of poisoned data responsible for the attack. Our method clusters training samples based on their impact on model parameters, then uses an efficient data unlearning method to prune innocent clusters. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our system on three types of dirty-label (backdoor) poison attacks and three types of clean-label poison attacks, across domains of computer vision and malware classification. Our system achieves over 98.4% precision and 96.8% recall across all attacks. We also show that our system is robust against four anti-forensics measures specifically designed to attack it.

> Modern scientific advancements often contribute to the introduction and refinement of never-before-seen technologies. This can be quite the task for humans to maintain and monitor and as a result, our society has become reliant on machine learning to assist in this task. With new technology comes new methods and thus new ways to circumvent existing cyber security measures. This study examines the effectiveness of three distinct Internet of Things cyber security algorithms currently used in industry today for malware and intrusion detection: Random Forest (RF), Support-Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Each algorithm was trained and tested on the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset which was published in January 2020 with the earliest of captures from 2018 and latest from 2019. The RF, SVM, and KNN reached peak accuracies of 92.96%, 86.23%, and 91.48%, respectively, in intrusion detection and 92.27%, 83.52%, and 89.80% in malware detection. It was found all three algorithms are capable of being effectively utilized for the current landscape of IoT cyber security in 2021.

> With the development of artificial intelligence algorithms like deep learning models and the successful applications in many different fields, further similar trails of deep learning technology have been made in cyber security area. It shows the preferable performance not only in academic security research but also in industry practices when dealing with part of cyber security issues by deep learning methods compared to those conventional rules. Especially for the malware detection and classification tasks, it saves generous time cost and promotes the accuracy for a total pipeline of malware detection system. In this paper, we construct special deep neural network, ie, MalDeepNet (TB-Malnet and IB-Malnet) for malware dynamic behavior classification tasks. Then we build the family clustering algorithm based on deep learning and fulfil related testing. Except that, we also design a novel malware prediction model which could detect the malware coming in future through the Mal Generative Adversarial Network (Mal-GAN) implementation. All those algorithms present fairly considerable value in related datasets afterwards.

> Existing malware detectors on safety-critical devices have difficulties in runtime detection due to the performance overhead. In this paper, we introduce PROPEDEUTICA, a framework for efficient and effective real-time malware detection, leveraging the best of conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In PROPEDEUTICA, all software start execution are considered as benign and monitored by a conventional ML classifier for fast detection. If the software receives a borderline classification from the ML detector (e.g. the software is 50% likely to be benign and 50% likely to be malicious), the software will be transferred to a more accurate, yet performance demanding DL detector. To address spatial-temporal dynamics and software execution heterogeneity, we introduce a novel DL architecture (DEEPMALWARE) for PROPEDEUTICA with multi-stream inputs. We evaluated PROPEDEUTICA with 9,115 malware samples and 1,338 benign software from various categories for the Windows OS. With a borderline interval of [30%-70%], PROPEDEUTICA achieves an accuracy of 94.34% and a false-positive rate of 8.75%, with 41.45% of the samples moved for DEEPMALWARE analysis. Even using only CPU, PROPEDEUTICA can detect malware within less than 0.1 seconds.

- `2109.09654v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09654v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09654v2)

> The deep learning approach to detecting malicious software (malware) is promising but has yet to tackle the problem of dataset shift, namely that the joint distribution of examples and their labels associated with the test set is different from that of the training set. This problem causes the degradation of deep learning models without users' notice. In order to alleviate the problem, one approach is to let a classifier not only predict the label on a given example but also present its uncertainty (or confidence) on the predicted label, whereby a defender can decide whether to use the predicted label or not. While intuitive and clearly important, the capabilities and limitations of this approach have not been well understood. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the quality of predictive uncertainties of malware detectors. Specifically, we re-design and build 24 Android malware detectors (by transforming four off-the-shelf detectors with six calibration methods) and quantify their uncertainties with nine metrics, including three metrics dealing with data imbalance. Our main findings are: (i) predictive uncertainty indeed helps achieve reliable malware detection in the presence of dataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (ii) approximate Bayesian methods are promising to calibrate and generalize malware detectors to deal with dataset shift, but cannot cope with adversarial evasion attacks; (iii) adversarial evasion attacks can render calibration methods useless, and it is an open problem to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predicted labels of adversarial examples (i.e., it is not effective to use predictive uncertainty to detect adversarial examples).

> In malware behavioral analysis, the list of accessed and created files very often indicates whether the examined file is malicious or benign. However, malware authors are trying to avoid detection by generating random filenames and/or modifying used filenames with new versions of the malware. These changes represent real-world adversarial examples. The goal of this work is to generate realistic adversarial examples and improve the classifier's robustness against these attacks. Our approach learns latent representations of input strings in an unsupervised fashion and uses gradient-based adversarial attack methods in the latent domain to generate adversarial examples in the input domain. We use these examples to improve the classifier's robustness by training on the generated adversarial set of strings. Compared to classifiers trained only on perturbed latent vectors, our approach produces classifiers that are significantly more robust without a large trade-off in standard accuracy.

> This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.

> Motivated by the transformative impact of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various domains, researchers and anti-virus vendors have proposed DNNs for malware detection from raw bytes that do not require manual feature engineering. In this work, we propose an attack that interweaves binary-diversification techniques and optimization frameworks to mislead such DNNs while preserving the functionality of binaries. Unlike prior attacks, ours manipulates instructions that are a functional part of the binary, which makes it particularly challenging to defend against. We evaluated our attack against three DNNs in white- and black-box settings, and found that it often achieved success rates near 100%. Moreover, we found that our attack can fool some commercial anti-viruses, in certain cases with a success rate of 85%. We explored several defenses, both new and old, and identified some that can foil over 80% of our evasion attempts. However, these defenses may still be susceptible to evasion by attacks, and so we advocate for augmenting malware-detection systems with methods that do not rely on machine learning.

> Robustness of machine learning models is critical for security related applications, where real-world adversaries are uniquely focused on evading neural network based detectors. Prior work mainly focus on crafting adversarial examples (AEs) with small uniform norm-bounded perturbations across features to maintain the requirement of imperceptibility. However, uniform perturbations do not result in realistic AEs in domains such as malware, finance, and social networks. For these types of applications, features typically have some semantically meaningful dependencies. The key idea of our proposed approach is to enable non-uniform perturbations that can adequately represent these feature dependencies during adversarial training. We propose using characteristics of the empirical data distribution, both on correlations between the features and the importance of the features themselves. Using experimental datasets for malware classification, credit risk prediction, and spam detection, we show that our approach is more robust to real-world attacks. Finally, we present robustness certification utilizing non-uniform perturbation bounds, and show that non-uniform bounds achieve better certification.

> Malware authors apply different obfuscation techniques on the generic feature of malware (i.e., unique malware signature) to create new variants to avoid detection. Existing Siamese Neural Network (SNN) based malware detection methods fail to correctly classify different malware families when similar generic features are shared across multiple malware variants resulting in high false-positive rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel Task-Aware Meta Learning-based Siamese Neural Network resilient against obfuscated malware while able to detect malware trained with one or a few training samples. Using entropy features of each malware signature alongside image features as task inputs, our task-aware meta leaner generates the parameters for the feature layers to more accurately adjust the feature embedding for different malware families. In addition, our model utilizes meta-learning with the extracted features of a pre-trained network (e.g., VGG-16) to avoid the bias typically associated with a model trained with a limited number of training samples. Our proposed approach is highly effective in recognizing unique malware signatures, thus correctly classifying malware samples that belong to the same malware family even in the presence of obfuscation technique applied to malware. Our experimental results, validated with N-way on N-shot learning, show that our model is highly effective in classification accuracy exceeding the rate>91% compared to other similar methods.

> This paper describes an ongoing experiment evaluating the efficacy of a digital safety intervention in six high-risk, low capacity Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Central Asia. The evaluation takes the form of statistical analysis of DNS traffic in each organisation, obtained via security tools installed by researchers.   The hypothesis is that the digital safety intervention strengthens the overall digital security posture of the CSOs, as measured by number of malware attacks intercepted by a cloud-based DNS firewall installed on the CSOs networks.   The research collects DNS traffic from CSOs that are participating in the digital safety intervention, and compares a treatment group consisting of four CSOs against DNS traffic from a second group of two CSOs in which the intervention has not yet taken place.   This project is ongoing, with data collection underway at a number of Central Asian CSOs. In this paper we outline the experimental design of the project, and look at the early data coming out of the DNS firewall. This is done to support the ultimate question of whether DNS data such as this can be used to accurately assess the efficacy of digital hygiene efforts.

> Driven by the high profit, Portable Executable (PE) malware has been consistently evolving in terms of both volume and sophistication. PE malware family classification has gained great attention and a large number of approaches have been proposed. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques and the exciting results they achieved on various tasks, machine learning algorithms have also gained popularity in the PE malware family classification task. Three mainstream approaches that use learning based algorithms, as categorized by the input format the methods take, are image-based, binary-based and disassembly-based approaches. Although a large number of approaches are published, there is no consistent comparisons on those approaches, especially from the practical industry adoption perspective. Moreover, there is no comparison in the scenario of concept drift, which is a fact for the malware classification task due to the fast evolving nature of malware. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study on learning-based PE malware classification approaches on 4 different datasets and consistent experiment settings. Based on the experiment results and an interview with our industry partners, we find that (1) there is no individual class of methods that significantly outperforms the others; (2) All classes of methods show performance degradation on concept drift (by an average F1-score of 32.23%); and (3) the prediction time and high memory consumption hinder existing approaches from being adopted for industry usage.

> This work explores the evaluation of a machine learning anomaly detector using custom-made parameterizable malware in an Internet of Things (IoT) Ecosystem. It is assumed that the malware has infected, and resides on, the Linux router that serves other devices on the network, as depicted in Figure 1. This IoT Ecosystem was developed as a testbed to evaluate the efficacy of a behavior-based anomaly detector. The malware consists of three types of custom-made malware: ransomware, cryptominer, and keylogger, which all have exfiltration capabilities to the network. The parameterization of the malware gives the malware samples multiple degrees of freedom, specifically relating to the rate and size of data exfiltration. The anomaly detector uses feature sets crafted from system calls and network traffic, and uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for behavioral-based anomaly detection. The custom-made malware is used to evaluate the situations where the SVM is effective, as well as the situations where it is not effective.

> Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks. However, most of them cannot provide an interpretation for their classification results. Machine learning models that are interpretable are usually linear or piecewise linear and yield inferior performance. Non-linear models achieve much better classification performance, but it is hard to interpret their classification results. This may have been changed by an interpretable feedforward neural network (IFFNN) proposed that achieves both high classification performance and interpretability for malware detection. If the IFFNN can perform well in a more flexible and general form for other classification tasks while providing meaningful interpretations, it may be of great interest to the applied machine learning community. In this paper, we propose a way to generalize the interpretable feedforward neural network to multi-class classification scenarios and any type of feedforward neural networks, and evaluate its classification performance and interpretability on intrinsic interpretable datasets. We conclude by finding that the generalized IFFNNs achieve comparable classification performance to their normal feedforward neural network counterparts and provide meaningful interpretations. Thus, this kind of neural network architecture has great practical use.

Ten types are present: nine classified as malware and one benign. Cursory examination reveals unequal class populations and other key aspects that must be considered when selecting classification and pre-processing methods. Exploratory analyses show possible identifiable characteristics from aggregate metrics (e.g., the pixel median values), and ways to reduce the number of features by identifying strong correlations. A model comparison shows that Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest algorithms produced the highest accuracy scores, thus showing promise for deeper scrutiny.

> Cyber security can be enhanced through application of machine learning by recasting network attack data into an image format, then applying supervised computer vision and other machine learning techniques to detect malicious specimens. Exploratory data analysis reveals little correlation and few distinguishing characteristics between the ten classes of malware used in this study. A general model comparison demonstrates that the most promising candidates for consideration are Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier. Convolutional networks fail to deliver their outstanding classification ability, being surpassed by a simple, fully connected architecture. Most tests fail to break 80% categorical accuracy and present low F1 scores, indicating more sophisticated approaches (e.g., bootstrapping, random samples, and feature selection) may be required to maximize performance.

> This work explores the use of machine learning techniques on an Internet-of-Things firmware dataset to detect malicious attempts to infect edge devices or subsequently corrupt an entire network. Firmware updates are uncommon in IoT devices; hence, they abound with vulnerabilities. Attacks against such devices can go unnoticed, and users can become a weak point in security. Malware can cause DDoS attacks and even spy on sensitive areas like peoples' homes. To help mitigate this threat, this paper employs a number of machine learning algorithms to classify IoT firmware and the best performing models are reported. In a general comparison, the top three algorithms are Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers. Deep learning approaches including Convolutional and Fully Connected Neural Networks with both experimental and proven successful architectures are also explored.

> AI methods have been proven to yield impressive performance on Android malware detection. However, most AI-based methods make predictions of suspicious samples in a black-box manner without transparency on models' inference. The expectation on models' explainability and transparency by cyber security and AI practitioners to assure the trustworthiness increases. In this article, we present a novel model-agnostic explanation method for AI models applied for Android malware detection. Our proposed method identifies and quantifies the data features relevance to the predictions by two steps: i) data perturbation that generates the synthetic data by manipulating features' values; and ii) optimization of features attribution values to seek significant changes of prediction scores on the perturbed data with minimal feature values changes. The proposed method is validated by three experiments. We firstly demonstrate that our proposed model explanation method can aid in discovering how AI models are evaded by adversarial samples quantitatively. In the following experiments, we compare the explainability and fidelity of our proposed method with state-of-the-arts, respectively.

> Host-based threats such as Program Attack, Malware Implantation, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), are commonly adopted by modern attackers. Recent studies propose leveraging the rich contextual information in data provenance to detect threats in a host. Data provenance is a directed acyclic graph constructed from system audit data. Nodes in a provenance graph represent system entities (e.g., $processes$ and $files$) and edges represent system calls in the direction of information flow. However, previous studies, which extract features of the whole provenance graph, are not sensitive to the small number of threat-related entities and thus result in low performance when hunting stealthy threats.   We present threaTrace, an anomaly-based detector that detects host-based threats at system entity level without prior knowledge of attack patterns. We tailor GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to learn every benign entity's role in a provenance graph. threaTrace is a real-time system, which is scalable of monitoring a long-term running host and capable of detecting host-based intrusion in their early phase. We evaluate threaTrace on three public datasets. The results show that threaTrace outperforms three state-of-the-art host intrusion detection systems.

> Malicious PDF documents present a serious threat to various security organizations that require modern threat intelligence platforms to effectively analyze and characterize the identity and behavior of PDF malware. State-of-the-art approaches use machine learning (ML) to learn features that characterize PDF malware. However, ML models are often susceptible to evasion attacks, in which an adversary obfuscates the malware code to avoid being detected by an Antivirus. In this paper, we derive a simple yet effective holistic approach to PDF malware detection that leverages signal and statistical analysis of malware binaries. This includes combining orthogonal feature space models from various static and dynamic malware detection methods to enable generalized robustness when faced with code obfuscations. Using a dataset of nearly 30,000 PDF files containing both malware and benign samples, we show that our holistic approach maintains a high detection rate (99.92%) of PDF malware and even detects new malicious files created by simple methods that remove the obfuscation conducted by malware authors to hide their malware, which are undetected by most antiviruses.

> With the growing number of malware and cyber attacks, there is a need for "orthogonal" cyber defense approaches, which are complementary to existing methods by detecting unique malware samples that are not predicted by other methods. In this paper, we propose a novel and orthogonal malware detection (OMD) approach to identify malware using a combination of audio descriptors, image similarity descriptors and other static/statistical features. First, we show how audio descriptors are effective in classifying malware families when the malware binaries are represented as audio signals. Then, we show that the predictions made on the audio descriptors are orthogonal to the predictions made on image similarity descriptors and other static features. Further, we develop a framework for error analysis and a metric to quantify how orthogonal a new feature set (or type) is with respect to other feature sets. This allows us to add new features and detection methods to our overall framework. Experimental results on malware datasets show that our approach provides a robust framework for orthogonal malware detection.

> Detection of malicious activities in corporate environments is a very complex task and much effort has been invested into research of its automation. However, vast majority of existing methods operate only in a narrow scope which limits them to capture only fragments of the evidence of malware's presence. Consequently, such approach is not aligned with the way how the cyber threats are studied and described by domain experts. In this work, we discuss these limitations and design a detection framework which combines observed events from different sources of data. Thanks to this, it provides full insight into the attack life cycle and enables detection of threats that require this coupling of observations from different telemetries to identify the full scope of the incident. We demonstrate applicability of the framework on a case study of a real malware infection observed in a corporate network.

> Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) ensures high-quality healthcare services by endowing distant and continual monitoring of patients' health conditions. The security and privacy of the sensitive health-related data transmitted through the WBAN should be preserved to maximize its benefits. In this regard, user authentication is one of the primary mechanisms to protect health data that verifies the identities of entities involved in the communication process. Since WBAN carries crucial health data, every entity engaged in the data transfer process must be authenticated. In literature, an end-to-end user authentication mechanism covering each communicating party is absent. Besides, most of the existing user authentication mechanisms are designed assuming that the patient's mobile phone is trusted. In reality, a patient's mobile phone can be stolen or comprised by malware and thus behaves maliciously. Our work addresses these drawbacks and proposes an end-to-end user authentication and session key agreement scheme between sensor nodes and medical experts in a scenario where the patient's mobile phone is semi-trusted. We present a formal security analysis using BAN logic. Besides, we also provide an informal security analysis of the proposed scheme. Both studies indicate that our method is robust against well-known security attacks. In addition, our scheme achieves comparable computation and communication costs concerning the related existing works. The simulation shows that our method preserves satisfactory network performance.

> In recent years, neural network has shown its strong power in various fields, and it also brings increasing security threats. The stegomalware based on neural network model is a representative one. Previous research preliminary proves the feasibility of launching malicious attacks by triggering malware embedded in the neural network model. However, the existing works have not shown that this emerging threat is practical in real-world attacks because of the low malware embedding rate, the high model performance degradation and the extra efforts. Therefore, we predict an improved stegomalware called EvilModel. We embed binary formed malware into neural network model as its parameters on the basis of analyzing the structure of the neural network model, and propose three new malware embedding technologies, namely MSB reservation, fast substitution and half substitution. By marrying 19 malware samples and 10 popular neural network models, we build 550 malware-embedded models, and analyze these models' performance on ImageNet dataset. The experimental results show that the half substitution almost performs perfectly, with a malware embedding rate of 48.52% and no model performance degradation or extra effort. Considering a series of factors, we propose a quantitative algorithm to evaluate the different embedding methods. The evaluation result indicates that EvilModel is much superior to the classic Stegonet. Additionally, we conduct a case study to trigger EvilModel in a real-world scenario. To understand the proposed malware embedding technology deeply, we also investigate the impact of neural network structures, layer and parameter size on malware embedding capacity and embedded model accuracy. We also give some possible countermeasures to defend EvilModel. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of such a novel AI-powered threat, and recommend to defense it in advance.

> Machine learning has witnessed tremendous growth in its adoption and advancement in the last decade. The evolution of machine learning from traditional algorithms to modern deep learning architectures has shaped the way today's technology functions. Its unprecedented ability to discover knowledge/patterns from unstructured data and automate the decision-making process led to its application in wide domains. High flying machine learning arena has been recently pegged back by the introduction of adversarial attacks. Adversaries are able to modify data, maximizing the classification error of the models. The discovery of blind spots in machine learning models has been exploited by adversarial attackers by generating subtle intentional perturbations in test samples. Increasing dependency on data has paved the blueprint for ever-high incentives to camouflage machine learning models. To cope with probable catastrophic consequences in the future, continuous research is required to find vulnerabilities in form of adversarial and design remedies in systems. This survey aims at providing the encyclopedic introduction to adversarial attacks that are carried out against malware detection systems. The paper will introduce various machine learning techniques used to generate adversarial and explain the structure of target files. The survey will also model the threat posed by the adversary and followed by brief descriptions of widely accepted adversarial algorithms. Work will provide a taxonomy of adversarial evasion attacks on the basis of attack domain and adversarial generation techniques. Adversarial evasion attacks carried out against malware detectors will be discussed briefly under each taxonomical headings and compared with concomitant researches. Analyzing the current research challenges in an adversarial generation, the survey will conclude by pinpointing the open future research directions.

> Machine learning based solutions have been successfully employed for automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.

> In recent years, the usage of ensemble learning in applications has grown significantly due to increasing computational power allowing the training of large ensembles in reasonable time frames. Many applications, e.g., malware detection, face recognition, or financial decision-making, use a finite set of learning algorithms and do aggregate them in a way that a better predictive performance is obtained than any other of the individual learning algorithms. In the field of Post-Silicon Validation for semiconductor devices (PSV), data sets are typically provided that consist of various devices like, e.g., chips of different manufacturing lines. In PSV, the task is to approximate the underlying function of the data with multiple learning algorithms, each trained on a device-specific subset, instead of improving the performance of arbitrary classifiers on the entire data set. Furthermore, the expectation is that an unknown number of subsets describe functions showing very different characteristics. Corresponding ensemble members, which are called outliers, can heavily influence the approximation. Our method aims to find a suitable approximation that is robust to outliers and represents the best or worst case in a way that will apply to as many types as possible. A 'soft-max' or 'soft-min' function is used in place of a maximum or minimum operator. A Neural Network (NN) is trained to learn this 'soft-function' in a two-stage process. First, we select a subset of ensemble members that is representative of the best or worst case. Second, we combine these members and define a weighting that uses the properties of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to increase the influence of non-outliers and to decrease outliers. The weighting ensures robustness to outliers and makes sure that approximations are suitable for most types.

> Universal Adversarial Perturbations are image-agnostic and model-independent noise that when added with any image can mislead the trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks into the wrong prediction. Since these Universal Adversarial Perturbations can seriously jeopardize the security and integrity of practical Deep Learning applications, existing techniques use additional neural networks to detect the existence of these noises at the input image source. In this paper, we demonstrate an attack strategy that when activated by rogue means (e.g., malware, trojan) can bypass these existing countermeasures by augmenting the adversarial noise at the AI hardware accelerator stage. We demonstrate the accelerator-level universal adversarial noise attack on several deep Learning models using co-simulation of the software kernel of Conv2D function and the Verilog RTL model of the hardware under the FuseSoC environment.

> Current state-of-the-art research for tackling the problem of malware detection and classification is centered on the design, implementation and deployment of systems powered by machine learning because of its ability to generalize to never-before-seen malware families and polymorphic mutations. However, it has been shown that machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, lack robustness against crafted inputs (adversarial examples). In this work, we have investigated the vulnerability of a state-of-the-art shallow convolutional neural network malware classifier against the dead code insertion technique. We propose a general framework powered by a Double Q-network to induce misclassification over malware families. The framework trains an agent through a convolutional neural network to select the optimal positions in a code sequence to insert dead code instructions so that the machine learning classifier mislabels the resulting executable. The experiments show that the proposed method significantly drops the classification accuracy of the classifier to 56.53% while having an evasion rate of 100% for the samples belonging to the Kelihos_ver3, Simda, and Kelihos_ver1 families. In addition, the average number of instructions needed to mislabel malware in comparison to a random agent decreased by 33%.

> With the advent of Industry 4.0, industrial facilities and critical infrastructures are transforming into an ecosystem of heterogeneous physical and cyber components, such as programmable logic controllers, increasingly interconnected and therefore exposed to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that may adversely affect the physical processes underlying industrial control systems. In this paper, we propose a formal approach based on runtime enforcement to ensure specification compliance in networks of controllers, possibly compromised by colluding malware that may tamper with actuator commands, sensor readings, and inter-controller communications. Our approach relies on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.'s edit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan's Timed Process Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet $P$ of observable actions and a timed correctness property $e$, returns a monitor that enforces the property $e$ during the execution of any (potentially corrupted) controller with alphabet $P$, and complying with the property $e$. Our monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted controllers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under scrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical requirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement enjoys deadlock- and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with scalability when dealing with networks of controllers. Finally, we test the proposed enforcement mechanism on a non-trivial case study, taken from the context of industrial water treatment systems, in which the controllers are injected with different malware with different malicious goals.

> With the advent of new technologies, using various formats of digital gadgets is becoming widespread. In today's world, where everyday tasks are inevitable without technology, this extensive use of computers paves the way for malicious activity. As a result, it is important to provide solutions to defend against these threats. Malware is one of the well-known and widely used means utilized for doing destructive activities by malicious attackers. Producing malware from scratch is somewhat difficult, so attackers tend to obfuscate existing malware and prepare it to become an unrecognizable program. Since creating new malware from an old one using obfuscation is a creative task, there are some drawbacks to identifying obfuscated malwares. In this research, we propose a solution to overcome this problem by converting the code to an image in the first step and then using a semi-supervised approach combined with contrastive learning. In this case, an obfuscation in the malware bytecode corresponds to an augmentation in the image. Hence, by utilizing meaningful augmentations, which simulate some obfuscation changes and combine them to generate complex ambiguity procedures, our proposed solution is able to construct, learn, and detect a wide range of obfuscations. This work addresses two issues: 1) malware classification despite the data deficiency and 2) obfuscated malware detection by training on non-obfuscated malwares. According to the results, the proposed method overcomes the data shortage problem in malware classification, as its accuracy is 90.1% when just 10% of data is used for training the model. Moreover, training on basic malwares without obfuscation achieved 96.21 percent accuracy in detecting obfuscated malware.

> Numerous open-source and commercial malware detectors are available. However, the efficacy of these tools has been threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection using, for example, machine learning techniques. In this work, we design an adversarial evasion attack that relies on both feature-space and problem-space manipulation. It uses explainability-guided feature selection to maximize evasion by identifying the most critical features that impact detection. We then use this attack as a benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art malware detectors. We find that (i) state-of-the-art malware detectors are vulnerable to even simple evasion strategies, and they can easily be tricked using off-the-shelf techniques; (ii) feature-space manipulation and problem-space obfuscation can be combined to enable evasion without needing white-box understanding of the detector; (iii) we can use explainability approaches (e.g., SHAP) to guide the feature manipulation and explain how attacks can transfer across multiple detectors. Our findings shed light on the weaknesses of current malware detectors, as well as how they can be improved.

> This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.

> The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a standardised interface between the firmware and the operating system used in all x86-based platforms over the past ten years. A side effect of the transition from conventional BIOS implementations to more complex and flexible implementations based on the UEFI was that it became easier for the malware to target BIOS in a widespread fashion, as these BIOS implementations are based on a common specification. This paper introduces Amaranth project - a solution to some of the contemporary security issues related to UEFI firmware. In this work we focused our attention on virtual machines as it allowed us to simplify the development of secure UEFI firmware. Security hardening of our firmware is achieved through several techniques, the most important of which are an operating system integrity checking mechanism (through snapshots) and overall firmware size reduction.
