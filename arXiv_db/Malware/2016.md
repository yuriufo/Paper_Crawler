<summary>2016-01-07 06:02:16 - BitAV: Fast Anti-Malware by Distributed Blockchain Consensus and Feedforward Scanning</summary>

- *Charles Noyes*

> I present the design and implementation of a novel anti-malware environment called BitAV. BitAV allows for the decentralization of the update and maintenance mechanisms of the software, traditionally performed by a central host, and uses a staggered scanning mechanism in order to improve performance. The peer-to-peer network maintenance mechanism lowered the average update propagation speed by 500% and is far less susceptible to targeted denial-of-service attacks. The feedforward scanning mechanism significantly improved end-to-end performance of the malware matching system, to a degree of an average 14x increase, by decomposing the file matching process into efficient queries that operate in verifiably constant time.

> Honeypots, i.e. networked computer systems specially designed and crafted to mimic the normal operations of other systems while capturing and storing information about the interactions with the world outside, are a crucial technology into the study of cyber threats and attacks that propagate and occur through networks. Among them, high interaction honeypots are considered the most efficient because the attacker (whether automated or not) perceives realistic interactions with the target machine. In the case of automated attacks, propagated by malwares, currently available honeypots alone are not specialized enough to allow the analysis of their behaviors and effects on the target system. The research presented in this paper shows how high interaction honeypots can be enhanced by powering them with specific features that improve the reverse engineering activities needed to effectively analyze captured malicious entities.

- *Roberto di Pietro, Federico Franzoni, Flavio Lombardi*

- `1601.05851v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05851v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05851v1)

> Effectively protecting the Windows OS is a challenging task, since most implementation details are not publicly known. Windows has always been the main target of malwares that have exploited numerous bugs and vulnerabilities. Recent trusted boot and additional integrity checks have rendered the Windows OS less vulnerable to kernel-level rootkits. Nevertheless, guest Windows Virtual Machines are becoming an increasingly interesting attack target. In this work we introduce and analyze a novel Hypervisor-Based Introspection System (HyBIS) we developed for protecting Windows OSes from malware and rootkits. The HyBIS architecture is motivated and detailed, while targeted experimental results show its effectiveness. Comparison with related work highlights main HyBIS advantages such as: effective semantic introspection, support for 64-bit architectures and for latest Windows (8.x and 10), advanced malware disabling capabilities. We believe the research effort reported here will pave the way to further advances in the security of Windows OSes.

<summary>2016-02-09 20:21:18 - Limiting Self-Propagating Malware Based on Connection Failure Behavior through Hyper-Compact Estimators</summary>

- *You Zhou, Yian Zhou, Shigang Chen, O. Patrick Kreidl*

- `1602.03153v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03153v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03153v1)

> Self-propagating malware (e.g., an Internet worm) exploits security loopholes in software to infect servers and then use them to scan the Internet for more vulnerable servers. While the mechanisms of worm infection and their propagation models are well understood, defense against worms remains an open problem. One branch of defense research investigates the behavioral difference between worm-infected hosts and normal hosts to set them apart. One particular observation is that a worm-infected host, which scans the Internet with randomly selected addresses, has a much higher connection-failure rate than a normal host. Rate-limit algorithms have been proposed to control the spread of worms by traffic shaping based on connection failure rate. However, these rate-limit algorithms can work properly only if it is possible to measure failure rates of individual hosts efficiently and accurately. This paper points out a serious problem in the prior method. To address this problem, we first propose a solution based on a highly efficient double-bitmap data structure, which places only a small memory footprint on the routers, while providing good measurement of connection failure rates whose accuracy can be tuned by system parameters. Furthermore, we propose another solution based on shared register array data structure, achieving better memory efficiency and much larger estimation range than our double-bitmap solution.

<summary>2016-02-19 19:47:49 - Preventive and Reactive Cyber Defense Dynamics Is Globally Stable</summary>

- *Ren Zheng, Wenlian Lu, Shouhuai Xu*

- `1602.06807v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06807v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06807v1)

> The recently proposed {\em cybersecurity dynamics} approach aims to understand cybersecurity from a holistic perspective by modeling the evolution of the global cybersecurity state. These models describe the interactions between the various kinds of cyber defenses and the various kinds of cyber attacks. We study a particular kind of cybersecurity dynamics caused by the interactions between preventive and reactive defenses (e.g., filtering and malware detection) against push- and pull-based cyber attacks (e.g., malware spreading and "drive-by download" attacks). The dynamics was previously shown to be globally stable in a {\em special} regime of the parameter universe, but little is known beyond this special regime. In this paper, we resolve an open problem in this domain by proving that the dynamics is globally stable in the {\em entire} parameter universe (i.e., the dynamics always converges to a unique equilibrium). We discuss the cybersecurity meanings and implications of this theoretic result. We also prove that the dynamics converges {\em exponentially} to the equilibrium except for a special parameter regime, in which case the dynamics converges {\em polynomially}. Since it is often difficult to compute the equilibrium, we propose new bounds of the equilibrium and numerically show that these bounds are tighter than those proposed in the literature.

- *Shahid Alam, Zhengyang Qu, Ryan Riley, Yan Chen, Vaibhav Rastogi*

- `1602.04693v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04693v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04693v2)

> According to the Symantec and F-Secure threat reports, mobile malware development in 2013 and 2014 has continued to focus almost exclusively ~99% on the Android platform. Malware writers are applying stealthy mutations (obfuscations) to create malware variants, thwarting detection by signature based detectors. In addition, the plethora of more sophisticated detectors making use of static analysis techniques to detect such variants operate only at the bytecode level, meaning that malware embedded in native code goes undetected. A recent study shows that 86% of the most popular Android applications contain native code, making this a plausible threat. This paper proposes DroidNative, an Android malware detector that uses specific control flow patterns to reduce the effect of obfuscations, provides automation and platform independence, and as far as we know is the first system that operates at the Android native code level, allowing it to detect malware embedded in both native code and bytecode. When tested with traditional malware variants it achieves a detection rate (DR) of 99.48%, compared to academic and commercial tools' DRs that range from 8.33% -- 93.22%. When tested with a dataset of 2240 samples DroidNative achieves a DR of 99.16%, a false positive rate of 0.4% and an average detection time of 26.87 sec/sample.

<summary>2016-03-02 06:16:51 - Decapitation via Digital Epidemics: A Bio-Inspired Transmissive Attack</summary>

- *Pin-Yu Chen, Ching-Chao Lin, Shin-Ming Cheng, Hsu-Chun Hsiao, Chun-Ying Huang*

- `1603.00588v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00588v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00588v1)

> The evolution of communication technology and the proliferation of electronic devices have rendered adversaries powerful means for targeted attacks via all sorts of accessible resources. In particular, owing to the intrinsic interdependency and ubiquitous connectivity of modern communication systems, adversaries can devise malware that propagates through intermediate hosts to approach the target, which we refer to as transmissive attacks. Inspired by biology, the transmission pattern of such an attack in the digital space much resembles the spread of an epidemic in real life. This paper elaborates transmissive attacks, summarizes the utility of epidemic models in communication systems, and draws connections between transmissive attacks and epidemic models. Simulations, experiments, and ongoing research challenges on transmissive attacks are also addressed.

<summary>2016-03-10 10:21:15 - Novel Feature Extraction, Selection and Fusion for Effective Malware Family Classification</summary>

- *Mansour Ahmadi, Dmitry Ulyanov, Stanislav Semenov, Mikhail Trofimov, Giorgio Giacinto*

- `1511.04317v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04317v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04317v2)

> Modern malware is designed with mutation characteristics, namely polymorphism and metamorphism, which causes an enormous growth in the number of variants of malware samples. Categorization of malware samples on the basis of their behaviors is essential for the computer security community, because they receive huge number of malware everyday, and the signature extraction process is usually based on malicious parts characterizing malware families. Microsoft released a malware classification challenge in 2015 with a huge dataset of near 0.5 terabytes of data, containing more than 20K malware samples. The analysis of this dataset inspired the development of a novel paradigm that is effective in categorizing malware variants into their actual family groups. This paradigm is presented and discussed in the present paper, where emphasis has been given to the phases related to the extraction, and selection of a set of novel features for the effective representation of malware samples. Features can be grouped according to different characteristics of malware behavior, and their fusion is performed according to a per-class weighting paradigm. The proposed method achieved a very high accuracy ($\approx$ 0.998) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset.

<summary>2016-03-11 04:03:27 - EMMA: A New Platform to Evaluate Hardware-based Mobile Malware Analyses</summary>

- *Mikhail Kazdagli, Ling Huang, Vijay Reddi, Mohit Tiwari*

- `1603.03086v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03086v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.03086v2)

> Hardware-based malware detectors (HMDs) are a key emerging technology to build trustworthy computing platforms, especially mobile platforms. Quantifying the efficacy of HMDs against malicious adversaries is thus an important problem. The challenge lies in that real-world malware typically adapts to defenses, evades being run in experimental settings, and hides behind benign applications. Thus, realizing the potential of HMDs as a line of defense - that has a small and battery-efficient code base - requires a rigorous foundation for evaluating HMDs.   To this end, we introduce EMMA - a platform to evaluate the efficacy of HMDs for mobile platforms. EMMA deconstructs malware into atomic, orthogonal actions and introduces a systematic way of pitting different HMDs against a diverse subset of malware hidden inside benign applications. EMMA drives both malware and benign programs with real user-inputs to yield an HMD's effective operating range - i.e., the malware actions a particular HMD is capable of detecting. We show that small atomic actions, such as stealing a Contact or SMS, have surprisingly large hardware footprints, and use this insight to design HMD algorithms that are less intrusive than prior work and yet perform 24.7% better. Finally, EMMA brings up a surprising new result - obfuscation techniques used by malware to evade static analyses makes them more detectable using HMDs.

<summary>2016-03-24 03:41:38 - Push- and Pull-based Epidemic Spreading in Networks: Thresholds and Deeper Insights</summary>

- *Shouhuai Xu, Wenlian Lu, Li Xu*

- `1603.07425v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07425v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07425v1)

> Understanding the dynamics of computer virus (malware, worm) in cyberspace is an important problem that has attracted a fair amount of attention. Early investigations for this purpose adapted biological epidemic models, and thus inherited the so-called homogeneity assumption that each node is equally connected to others. Later studies relaxed this often-unrealistic homogeneity assumption, but still focused on certain power-law networks. Recently, researchers investigated epidemic models in {\em arbitrary} networks (i.e., no restrictions on network topology). However, all these models only capture {\em push-based} infection, namely that an infectious node always actively attempts to infect its neighboring nodes. Very recently, the concept of {\em pull-based} infection was introduced but was not treated rigorously. Along this line of research, the present paper investigates push- and pull-based epidemic spreading dynamics in arbitrary networks, using a Non-linear Dynamical Systems approach. The paper advances the state of the art as follows: (1) It presents a more general and powerful sufficient condition (also known as epidemic threshold in the literature) under which the spreading will become stable. (2) It gives both upper and lower bounds on the global mean infection rate, regardless of the stability of the spreading. (3) It offers insights into, among other things, the estimation of the global mean infection rate through localized monitoring of a small {\em constant} number of nodes, {\em without} knowing the values of the parameters.

<summary>2016-03-28 05:22:33 - Optimizing Active Cyber Defense</summary>

- *Wenlian Lu, Shouhuai Xu, Xinlei Yi*

> Active cyber defense is one important defensive method for combating cyber attacks. Unlike traditional defensive methods such as firewall-based filtering and anti-malware tools, active cyber defense is based on spreading "white" or "benign" worms to combat against the attackers' malwares (i.e., malicious worms) that also spread over the network. In this paper, we initiate the study of {\em optimal} active cyber defense in the setting of strategic attackers and/or strategic defenders. Specifically, we investigate infinite-time horizon optimal control and fast optimal control for strategic defenders (who want to minimize their cost) against non-strategic attackers (who do not consider the issue of cost). We also investigate the Nash equilibria for strategic defenders and attackers. We discuss the cyber security meanings/implications of the theoretic results. Our study brings interesting open problems for future research.

> The Internet is a man-made complex system under constant attacks (e.g., Advanced Persistent Threats and malwares). It is therefore important to understand the phenomena that can be induced by the interaction between cyber attacks and cyber defenses. In this paper, we explore the rich phenomena that can be exhibited when the defender employs active defense to combat cyber attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that {\em active cyber defense dynamics} (or more generally, {\em cybersecurity dynamics}) can exhibit the bifurcation and chaos phenomena. This has profound implications for cyber security measurement and prediction: (i) it is infeasible (or even impossible) to accurately measure and predict cyber security under certain circumstances; (ii) the defender must manipulate the dynamics to avoid such {\em unmanageable situations} in real-life defense operations.

> Constructing lineages of malware is an important cyber-defense task. Performing this task is difficult, however, due to the amount of malware data and obfuscation techniques by the authors. In this work, we formulate the lineage task as a probabilistic model, and use a novel probabilistic programming solution to jointly infer the lineage and creation times of families of malware.

- *Daniel Gruss, Clémentine Maurice, Klaus Wagner, Stefan Mangard*

- `1511.04594v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04594v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04594v3)

> Research on cache attacks has shown that CPU caches leak significant information. Proposed detection mechanisms assume that all cache attacks cause more cache hits and cache misses than benign applications and use hardware performance counters for detection.   In this article, we show that this assumption does not hold by developing a novel attack technique: the Flush+Flush attack. The Flush+Flush attack only relies on the execution time of the flush instruction, which depends on whether data is cached or not. Flush+Flush does not make any memory accesses, contrary to any other cache attack. Thus, it causes no cache misses at all and the number of cache hits is reduced to a minimum due to the constant cache flushes. Therefore, Flush+Flush attacks are stealthy, i.e., the spy process cannot be detected based on cache hits and misses, or state-of-the-art detection mechanisms. The Flush+Flush attack runs in a higher frequency and thus is faster than any existing cache attack. With 496 KB/s in a cross-core covert channel it is 6.7 times faster than any previously published cache covert channel.

> A fundamental assumption in software security is that a memory location can only be modified by processes that may write to this memory location. However, a recent study has shown that parasitic effects in DRAM can change the content of a memory cell without accessing it, but by accessing other memory locations in a high frequency. This so-called Rowhammer bug occurs in most of today's memory modules and has fatal consequences for the security of all affected systems, e.g., privilege escalation attacks.   All studies and attacks related to Rowhammer so far rely on the availability of a cache flush instruction in order to cause accesses to DRAM modules at a sufficiently high frequency. We overcome this limitation by defeating complex cache replacement policies. We show that caches can be forced into fast cache eviction to trigger the Rowhammer bug with only regular memory accesses. This allows to trigger the Rowhammer bug in highly restricted and even scripting environments.   We demonstrate a fully automated attack that requires nothing but a website with JavaScript to trigger faults on remote hardware. Thereby we can gain unrestricted access to systems of website visitors. We show that the attack works on off-the-shelf systems. Existing countermeasures fail to protect against this new Rowhammer attack.

> Eliminating vulnerabilities from low-level code is vital for securing software. Static analysis is a promising approach for discovering vulnerabilities since it can provide developers early feedback on the code they write. But, it presents multiple challenges not the least of which is understanding what makes a bug exploitable and conveying this information to the developer. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a practical vulnerability assessment framework, called Melange. Melange performs data and control flow analysis to diagnose potential security bugs, and outputs well-formatted bug reports that help developers understand and fix security bugs. Based on the intuition that real-world vulnerabilities manifest themselves across multiple parts of a program, Melange performs both local and global analyses. To scale up to large programs, global analysis is demand-driven. Our prototype detects multiple vulnerability classes in C and C++ code including type confusion, and garbage memory reads. We have evaluated Melange extensively. Our case studies show that Melange scales up to large codebases such as Chromium, is easy-to-use, and most importantly, capable of discovering vulnerabilities in real-world code. Our findings indicate that static analysis is a viable reinforcement to the software testing tool set.

- *Mohsin Junaid, Donggang Liu, David Kung*

- `1506.05217v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05217v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05217v2)

> The amount of Android malware has increased greatly during the last few years. Static analysis is widely used in detecting such malware by analyzing the code without execution. The effectiveness of current tools relies on the app model as well as the malware detection algorithm which analyzes the app model. If the model and/or the algorithm is inadequate, then sophisticated attacks that are triggered by specific sequences of events will not be detected.   This paper presents a static analysis framework called Dexteroid, which uses reverse-engineered life cycle models to accurately capture the behaviors of Android components. Dexteroid systematically derives event sequences from the models, and uses them to detect attacks launched by specific ordering of events. A prototype implementation of Dexteroid detects two types of attacks: (1) leakage of private information, and (2) sending SMS to premium-rate numbers. A series of experiments are conducted on 1526 Google Play apps, 1259 Genome Malware apps, and a suite of benchmark apps called DroidBench and the results are compared with a state-of-the-art static analysis tool called FlowDroid. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework is effective and efficient in terms of precision, recall, and execution time.

- `1604.02734v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02734v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02734v1)

> Modern cloud services are designed to encourage and support collaboration. To help users share links to online documents, maps, etc., several services, including cloud storage providers such as Microsoft OneDrive and mapping services such as Google Maps, directly integrate URL shorteners that convert long, unwieldy URLs into short URLs, consisting of a domain such as 1drv.ms or goo.gl and a short token.   In this paper, we demonstrate that the space of 5- and 6-character tokens included in short URLs is so small that it can be scanned using brute-force search. Therefore, all online resources that were intended to be shared with a few trusted friends or collaborators are effectively public and can be accessed by anyone. This leads to serious security and privacy vulnerabilities.   In the case of cloud storage, we focus on Microsoft OneDrive. We show how to use short-URL enumeration to discover and read shared content stored in the OneDrive cloud, including even files for which the user did not generate a short URL. 7% of the OneDrive accounts exposed in this fashion allow anyone to write into them. Since cloud-stored files are automatically copied into users' personal computers and devices, this is a vector for large-scale, automated malware injection.   In the case of online maps, we show how short-URL enumeration reveals the directions that users shared with each other. For many individual users, this enables inference of their residential addresses, true identities, and extremely sensitive locations they visited that, if publicly revealed, would violate medical and financial privacy.

> Architectures relying on continuous authentication require a secure way to challenge the user's identity without trusting that the Continuous Authentication Subsystem (CAS) has not been compromised, i.e., that the response to the layer which manages service/application access is not fake. In this paper, we introduce the CALIPER protocol, in which a separate Continuous Access Verification Entity (CAVE) directly challenges the user's identity in a continuous authentication regime. Instead of simply returning authentication probabilities or confidence scores, CALIPER's CAS uses live hard and soft biometric samples from the user to extract a cryptographic private key embedded in a challenge posed by the CAVE. The CAS then uses this key to sign a response to the CAVE. CALIPER supports multiple modalities, key lengths, and security levels and can be applied in two scenarios: One where the CAS must authenticate its user to a CAVE running on a remote server (device-server) for access to remote application data, and another where the CAS must authenticate its user to a locally running trusted computing module (TCM) for access to local application data (device-TCM). We further demonstrate that CALIPER can leverage device hardware resources to enable privacy and security even when the device's kernel is compromised, and we show how this authentication protocol can even be expanded to obfuscate direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) malwares.

> We present and evaluate a large-scale malware detection system integrating machine learning with expert reviewers, treating reviewers as a limited labeling resource. We demonstrate that even in small numbers, reviewers can vastly improve the system's ability to keep pace with evolving threats. We conduct our evaluation on a sample of VirusTotal submissions spanning 2.5 years and containing 1.1 million binaries with 778GB of raw feature data. Without reviewer assistance, we achieve 72% detection at a 0.5% false positive rate, performing comparable to the best vendors on VirusTotal. Given a budget of 80 accurate reviews daily, we improve detection to 89% and are able to detect 42% of malicious binaries undetected upon initial submission to VirusTotal. Additionally, we identify a previously unnoticed temporal inconsistency in the labeling of training datasets. We compare the impact of training labels obtained at the same time training data is first seen with training labels obtained months later. We find that using training labels obtained well after samples appear, and thus unavailable in practice for current training data, inflates measured detection by almost 20 percentage points. We release our cluster-based implementation, as well as a list of all hashes in our evaluation and 3% of our entire dataset.

CrowdSource "learns" a mapping between low-level language and high-level software functionality by leveraging millions of web technical documents from StackExchange, a popular network of technical question and answer sites, using this mapping to infer malware capabilities. This paper describes our approach and provides an evaluation of its accuracy and performance, demonstrating that it can detect at least 14 high-level malware capabilities in unpacked malware binaries with an average per-capability f-score of 0.86 and at a rate of tens of thousands of binaries per day on commodity hardware.

> Mass-market mobile security threats have increased recently due to the growth of mobile technologies and the popularity of mobile devices. Accordingly, techniques have been introduced for identifying, classifying, and defending against mobile threats utilizing static, dynamic, on-device, off-device, and hybrid approaches. In this paper, we contribute to the mobile security defense posture by introducing Andro-profiler, a hybrid behavior based analysis and classification system for mobile malware. Andro-profiler classifies malware by exploiting the behavior profiling extracted from the integrated system logs including system calls, which are implicitly equivalent to distinct behavior characteristics. Andro-profiler executes a malicious application on an emulator in order to generate the integrated system logs, and creates human-readable behavior profiles by analyzing the integrated system logs. By comparing the behavior profile of malicious application with representative behavior profile for each malware family, Andro-profiler detects and classifies it into malware families. The experiment results demonstrate that Andro-profiler is scalable, performs well in detecting and classifying malware with accuracy greater than $98\%$, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art work, and is capable of identifying zero-day mobile malware samples.

> As the security landscape evolves over time, where thousands of species of malicious codes are seen every day, antivirus vendors strive to detect and classify malware families for efficient and effective responses against malware campaigns. To enrich this effort, and by capitalizing on ideas from the social network analysis domain, we build a tool that can help classify malware families using features driven from the graph structure of their system calls. To achieve that, we first construct a system call graph that consists of system calls found in the execution of the individual malware families. To explore distinguishing features of various malware species, we study social network properties as applied to the call graph, including the degree distribution, degree centrality, average distance, clustering coefficient, network density, and component ratio. We utilize features driven from those properties to build a classifier for malware families. Our experimental results show that influence-based graph metrics such as the degree centrality are effective for classifying malware, whereas the general structural metrics of malware are less effective for classifying malware. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs well in detecting and classifying malware families within each malware class with accuracy greater than 96%.

> This paper focuses on the anticipatory enhancement of methods of detecting stealth software. Cyber security detection tools are insufficiently powerful to reveal the most recent cyber-attacks which use malware. In this paper, we will present first an idea of the highest stealth malware, as this is the most complicated scenario for detection because it combines both existing anti-forensic techniques together with their potential improvements. Second, we present new detection methods, which are resilient to this hidden prototype. To help solve this detection challenge, we have analyzed Windows memory content using a new method of Shannon Entropy calculation; methods of digital photogrammetry; the Zipf Mandelbrot law, as well as by disassembling the memory content and analyzing the output. Finally, we present an idea and architecture of the software tool, which uses CUDA enabled GPU hardware to speed-up memory forensics. All three ideas are currently a work in progress.

> Deep neural networks, like many other machine learning models, have recently been shown to lack robustness against adversarially crafted inputs. These inputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected perturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired misclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific to the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be conveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual appearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more security-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose significant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for failure.   In this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample crafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The application domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints in the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision domain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete, often binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance unchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of malware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set. We furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against adversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification. While feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation and re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.

> Because computers may contain or interact with sensitive information, they are often air-gapped and in this way kept isolated and disconnected from the Internet. In recent years the ability of malware to communicate over an air-gap by transmitting sonic and ultrasonic signals from a computer speaker to a nearby receiver has been shown. In order to eliminate such acoustic channels, current best practice recommends the elimination of speakers (internal or external) in secure computers, thereby creating a so-called 'audio-gap'. In this paper, we present Fansmitter, a malware that can acoustically exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers, even when audio hardware and speakers are not present. Our method utilizes the noise emitted from the CPU and chassis fans which are present in virtually every computer today. We show that a software can regulate the internal fans' speed in order to control the acoustic waveform emitted from a computer. Binary data can be modulated and transmitted over these audio signals to a remote microphone (e.g., on a nearby mobile phone). We present Fansmitter's design considerations, including acoustic signature analysis, data modulation, and data transmission. We also evaluate the acoustic channel, present our results, and discuss countermeasures. Using our method we successfully transmitted data from air-gapped computer without audio hardware, to a smartphone receiver in the same room. We demonstrated the effective transmission of encryption keys and passwords from a distance of zero to eight meters, with bit rate of up to 900 bits/hour. We show that our method can also be used to leak data from different types of IT equipment, embedded systems, and IoT devices that have no audio hardware, but contain fans of various types and sizes.

> In this paper, we propose a novel graph kernel specifically to address a challenging problem in the field of cyber-security, namely, malware detection. Previous research has revealed the following: (1) Graph representations of programs are ideally suited for malware detection as they are robust against several attacks, (2) Besides capturing topological neighbourhoods (i.e., structural information) from these graphs it is important to capture the context under which the neighbourhoods are reachable to accurately detect malicious neighbourhoods.   We observe that state-of-the-art graph kernels, such as Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (WLK) capture the structural information well but fail to capture contextual information. To address this, we develop the Contextual Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (CWLK) which is capable of capturing both these types of information. We show that for the malware detection problem, CWLK is more expressive and hence more accurate than WLK while maintaining comparable efficiency. Through our large-scale experiments with more than 50,000 real-world Android apps, we demonstrate that CWLK outperforms two state-of-the-art graph kernels (including WLK) and three malware detection techniques by more than 5.27% and 4.87% F-measure, respectively, while maintaining high efficiency. This high accuracy and efficiency make CWLK suitable for large-scale real-world malware detection.

> Combating malware is very important for software/systems security, but to prevent the software/systems from the advanced malware, viz. metamorphic malware is a challenging task, as it changes the structure/code after each infection. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel approach to detect the advanced malware with high accuracy by analyzing the occurrence of opcodes (features) by grouping the executables. These groups are made on the basis of our earlier studies [1] that the difference between the sizes of any two malware generated by popular advanced malware kits viz. PS-MPC, G2 and NGVCK are within 5 KB. On the basis of obtained promising features, we studied the performance of thirteen classifiers using N-fold cross-validation available in machine learning tool WEKA. Among these thirteen classifiers we studied in-depth top five classifiers (Random forest, LMT, NBT, J48 and FT) and obtain more than 96.28% accuracy for the detection of unknown malware, which is better than the maximum detection accuracy (95.9%) reported by Santos et al (2013). In these top five classifiers, our approach obtained a detection accuracy of 97.95% by the Random forest.

> The metamorphic malware variants with the same malicious behavior (family), can obfuscate themselves to look different from each other. This variation in structure leads to a huge signature database for traditional signature matching techniques to detect them. In order to effective and efficient detection of malware in large amounts of executables, we need to partition these files into groups which can identify their respective families. In addition, the grouping criteria should be chosen such a way that, it can also be applied to unknown files encounter on computers for classification. This paper discusses the study of malware and benign executables in groups to detect unknown malware with high accuracy. We studied sizes of malware generated by three popular second generation malware (metamorphic malware) creator kits viz. G2, PS-MPC and NGVCK, and observed that the size variation in any two generated malware from same kit is not much. Hence, we grouped the executables on the basis of malware sizes by using Optimal k-Means Clustering algorithm and used these obtained groups to select promising features for training (Random forest, J48, LMT, FT and NBT) classifiers to detect variants of malware or unknown malware. We find that detection of malware on the basis of their respected file sizes gives accuracy up to 99.11% from the classifiers.

We find that the second method to detect the malware with ~8.7% more accurate than the first/regular method.

> In this paper, we present subgraph2vec, a novel approach for learning latent representations of rooted subgraphs from large graphs inspired by recent advancements in Deep Learning and Graph Kernels. These latent representations encode semantic substructure dependencies in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models for tasks such as graph classification, clustering, link prediction and community detection. subgraph2vec leverages on local information obtained from neighbourhoods of nodes to learn their latent representations in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs, SVMs and relational data clustering algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies. Also, we show that the subgraph vectors could be used for building a deep learning variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Our experiments on several benchmark and large-scale real-world datasets reveal that subgraph2vec achieves significant improvements in accuracies over existing graph kernels on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically, on two realworld program analysis tasks, namely, code clone and malware detection, subgraph2vec outperforms state-of-the-art kernels by more than 17% and 4%, respectively.

> We study the propagation of a malicious software in a network of mobile devices, which are moving in a specific city area, and establish time bounds for the activation of a counter-measure, i.e., an antivirus or a cleaner in order to prevent pandemic. More precisely, given an initial infected population (mobile devices), we establish upper bounds on the time needed for a counter-measure to take effect after infection (response-time), in order to prevent the rest susceptible devices to get infected. Thus, within a period of time, we guarantee that not all the susceptible devices in the city get infected and the infected ones get sanitized. In our work, we first propose a malware propagation model along with a device mobility model and then, utilizing these models, we develop a simulator that we use to study the spread of malware in such networks. Finally, we provide experimental results for the pandemic prevention taken by our simulator for various response-time intervals.

> The use of TLS by malware poses new challenges to network threat detection because traditional pattern-matching techniques can no longer be applied to its messages. However, TLS also introduces a complex set of observable data features that allow many inferences to be made about both the client and the server. We show that these features can be used to detect and understand malware communication, while at the same time preserving the privacy of benign uses of encryption. These data features also allow for accurate malware family attribution of network communication, even when restricted to a single, encrypted flow.   To demonstrate this, we performed a detailed study of how TLS is used by malware and enterprise applications. We provide a general analysis on millions of TLS encrypted flows, and a targeted study on 18 malware families composed of thousands of unique malware samples and ten-of-thousands of malicious TLS flows. Importantly, we identify and accommodate the bias introduced by the use of a malware sandbox. The performance of a malware classifier is correlated with a malware family's use of TLS, i.e., malware families that actively evolve their use of cryptography are more difficult to classify.   We conclude that malware's usage of TLS is distinct from benign usage in an enterprise setting, and that these differences can be effectively used in rules and machine learning classifiers.

> The recent evolution on the smart phone technology has made its application market huge and less secure. Every single day large number of apps introduced in the android market (mostly on google play store) without any particular inspections which creates a lot of security issues and they remain unresolved. There are a lot of recent and increasing security issues which are mostly caused by the android apps. Mainly, the access of user data through the apps relied on the users given permission to apps.So, it is always a big question that how different apps on the android smart phones bypass the android permission model to have root access and how user data compromised or stolen by its apps. It is not startling that the Google Play Store has massive number of malicious apps that may gain users attention to fall victim for one, but some time it might be even worse than we thought. In this paper, we will look at the security issues (i.e. rooting phone, malware bypassing and secondary storage) and how easy to get access to users phone by using its app.   Furthermore, I will discuss the android update mechanism and its functionalities as well as vulnerability to possible third party bypassing and root access. Moreover, a key feature and source of the all possible access route to android applications I will discuss an android permission model.

> Android is becoming ubiquitous and currently has the largest share of the mobile OS market with billions of application downloads from the official app market. It has also become the platform most targeted by mobile malware that are becoming more sophisticated to evade state-of-the-art detection approaches. Many Android malware families employ obfuscation techniques in order to avoid detection and this may defeat static analysis based approaches. Dynamic analysis on the other hand may be used to overcome this limitation. Hence in this paper we propose DynaLog, a dynamic analysis based framework for characterizing Android applications. The framework provides the capability to analyse the behaviour of applications based on an extensive number of dynamic features. It provides an automated platform for mass analysis and characterization of apps that is useful for quickly identifying and isolating malicious applications. The DynaLog framework leverages existing open source tools to extract and log high level behaviours, API calls, and critical events that can be used to explore the characteristics of an application, thus providing an extensible dynamic analysis platform for detecting Android malware. DynaLog is evaluated using real malware samples and clean applications demonstrating its capabilities for effective analysis and detection of malicious applications.

Using real malware samples and benign applications, a composite classification model is developed from parallel combination of heterogeneous classifiers. The empirical evaluation of the model under different combination schemes demonstrates its efficacy and potential to improve detection accuracy. More importantly, by utilizing several classifiers with diverse characteristics, their strengths can be harnessed not only for enhanced Android malware detection but also quicker white box analysis by means of the more interpretable constituent classifiers.

> Enterprise networks are in constant danger of being breached by cyber-attackers, but making the decision about what security tools to deploy to mitigate this risk requires carefully designed evaluation of security products. One of the most important metrics for a protection product is how well it is able to stop malware, specifically on "zero"-day malware that has not been seen by the security community before. However, evaluating zero-day performance is difficult, because of larger number of previously unseen samples that are needed to properly measure the true and false positive rate, and the challenges involved in accurately labeling these samples. This paper addresses these issues from a statistical and practical perspective. Our contributions include first showing that the number of benign files needed for proper evaluation is on the order of a millions, and the number of malware samples needed is on the order of tens of thousands. We then propose and justify a time-delay method for easily collecting large number of previously unseen, but labeled, samples. This enables cheap and accurate evaluation of zero-day true and false positive rates. Finally, we propose a more fine-grain labeling of the malware/benignware in order to better model the heterogeneous distribution of files on various networks.

> With over 50 billion downloads and more than 1.3 million apps in the Google official market, Android has continued to gain popularity amongst smartphone users worldwide. At the same time there has been a rise in malware targeting the platform, with more recent strains employing highly sophisticated detection avoidance techniques. As traditional signature based methods become less potent in detecting unknown malware, alternatives are needed for timely zero-day discovery. Thus this paper proposes an approach that utilizes ensemble learning for Android malware detection. It combines advantages of static analysis with the efficiency and performance of ensemble machine learning to improve Android malware detection accuracy. The machine learning models are built using a large repository of malware samples and benign apps from a leading antivirus vendor. Experimental results and analysis presented shows that the proposed method which uses a large feature space to leverage the power of ensemble learning is capable of 97.3 to 99 percent detection accuracy with very low false positive rates.

Android has surpassed other mobile platforms as the most popular whilst also witnessing a dramatic increase in malware targeting the platform. A worrying trend that is emerging is the increasing sophistication of Android malware to evade detection by traditional signature-based scanners. As such, Android app marketplaces remain at risk of hosting malicious apps that could evade detection before being downloaded by unsuspecting users. Hence, in this paper we present an effective approach to alleviate this problem based on Bayesian classification models obtained from static code analysis. The models are built from a collection of code and app characteristics that provide indicators of potential malicious activities. The models are evaluated with real malware samples in the wild and results of experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

> In this paper, we propose a malware categorization method that models malware behavior in terms of instructions using PageRank. PageRank computes ranks of web pages based on structural information and can also compute ranks of instructions that represent the structural information of the instructions in malware analysis methods. Our malware categorization method uses the computed ranks as features in machine learning algorithms. In the evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of different PageRank algorithms and also investigate bagging and boosting algorithms to improve the categorization accuracy.

> Air-gapped computers are disconnected from the Internet physically and logically. This measure is taken in order to prevent the leakage of sensitive data from secured networks. In the past, it has been shown that malware can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers by transmitting ultrasonic signals via the computer's speakers. However, such acoustic communication relies on the availability of speakers on a computer. In this paper, we present 'DiskFiltration,' a covert channel which facilitates the leakage of data from an air-gapped compute via acoustic signals emitted from its hard disk drive (HDD). Our method is unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it doesn't require the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the air-gapped computer. A malware installed on a compromised machine can generate acoustic emissions at specific audio frequencies by controlling the movements of the HDD's actuator arm. Digital Information can be modulated over the acoustic signals and then be picked up by a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, etc.). We examine the HDD anatomy and analyze its acoustical characteristics. We also present signal generation and detection, and data modulation and demodulation algorithms. Based on our proposed method, we developed a transmitter on a personal computer and a receiver on a smartphone, and we provide the design and implementation details. We also evaluate our covert channel on various types of internal and external HDDs in different computer chassis and at various distances. With DiskFiltration we were able to covertly transmit data (e.g., passwords, encryption keys, and keylogging data) between air-gapped computers to a smartphone at an effective bit rate of 180 bits/minute (10,800 bits/hour) and a distance of up to two meters (six feet).

> In order to limit the damage of malware on Mac OS X and iOS, Apple uses sandboxing, a kernel-level security layer that provides tight constraints for system calls. Particularly used for Apple iOS, sandboxing prevents apps from executing potentially dangerous actions, by defining rules in a sandbox profile. Investigating Apple's built-in sandbox profiles is difficult as they are compiled and stored in binary format. We present SandBlaster, a software bundle that is able to reverse/decompile Apple binary sandbox profiles to their original human readable SBPL (SandBox Profile Language) format. We use SandBlaster to reverse all built-in Apple iOS binary sandbox profiles for iOS 7, 8 and 9. Our tool is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide a full reversing of the Apple sandbox, shedding light into the inner workings of Apple sandbox profiles and providing essential support for security researchers and professionals interested in Apple security mechanisms.

> Remote attestation is a crucial security service particularly relevant to increasingly popular IoT (and other embedded) devices. It allows a trusted party (verifier) to learn the state of a remote, and potentially malware-infected, device (prover). Most existing approaches are static in nature and only check whether benign software is initially loaded on the prover. However, they are vulnerable to run-time attacks that hijack the application's control or data flow, e.g., via return-oriented programming or data-oriented exploits. As a concrete step towards more comprehensive run-time remote attestation, we present the design and implementation of Control- FLow ATtestation (C-FLAT) that enables remote attestation of an application's control-flow path, without requiring the source code. We describe a full prototype implementation of C-FLAT on Raspberry Pi using its ARM TrustZone hardware security extensions. We evaluate C-FLAT's performance using a real-world embedded (cyber-physical) application, and demonstrate its efficacy against control-flow hijacking attacks.

> Mobile malware has been growing in scale and complexity spurred by the unabated uptake of smartphones worldwide. Android is fast becoming the most popular mobile platform resulting in sharp increase in malware targeting the platform. Additionally, Android malware is evolving rapidly to evade detection by traditional signature-based scanning. Despite current detection measures in place, timely discovery of new malware is still a critical issue. This calls for novel approaches to mitigate the growing threat of zero-day Android malware. Hence, in this paper we develop and analyze proactive Machine Learning approaches based on Bayesian classification aimed at uncovering unknown Android malware via static analysis. The study, which is based on a large malware sample set of majority of the existing families, demonstrates detection capabilities with high accuracy. Empirical results and comparative analysis are presented offering useful insight towards development of effective static-analytic Bayesian classification based solutions for detecting unknown Android malware.

> In spam and malware detection, attackers exploit randomization to obfuscate malicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time; e.g., malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte sequences to hide known exploits. Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this work, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a non-cooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one to improve the trade-off between attack detection and false alarms with respect to state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design, on application examples including handwritten digit recognition, spam and malware detection.

> This study evaluates the cyber-risks to Business Information Assets posed by the adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) to the workplace. BYOD is an emerging trend where employees bring and use personal computing devices on the companys network to access applications and sensitive data like emails, calendar and scheduling applications, documents, etc. Employees are captivated by BYOD because they can have access to private items as well as perform certain job functions while being unrestricted to their desks. This is however usually done on the blind side of management or the system administrator; a situation that tends to expose vital and sensitive corporate information to various threats like unwanted network traffic, unknown applications, malwares, and viruses. Expert opinions were elicited in this exploratory study. The study evaluated the characteristics of BYOD, assessed associated risks, threats and vulnerabilities. The findings indicate that little or no security measures were instituted to mitigate risks associated with BYOD. Though, profound benefits abound with BYOD adoption, they could be eroded by security threats and costs of mitigation in curing breaches. The most significant risk was found to be Data Loss which was in consonance with similar studies on Smartphone security risks. Some mitigation measures are then recommended.

> As currently classical malware detection methods based on signatures fail to detect new malware, they are not always efficient with new obfuscation techniques. Besides, new malware is easily created and old malware can be recoded to produce new one. Therefore, classical Antivirus becomes consistently less effective in dealing with those new threats. Also malware gets hand tailored to bypass network security and Antivirus. But as analysts do not have enough time to dissect suspected malware by hand, automated approaches have been developed. To cope with the mass of new malware, statistical and machine learning methods proved to be a good approach classifying programs, especially when using multiple approaches together to provide a likelihood of software being malicious. In normal approach, some steps have been taken, mostly by analyzing the opcodes or mnemonics of disassembly and their distribution. In this paper, we focus on the control flow change (CFC) itself and finding out if it is significant to detect malware. In the scope of this work, only relative control flow changes are contemplated, as these are easier to extract from the first chosen disassembler library and are within a range of 256 addresses. These features are analyzed as a raw feature, as n-grams of length 2, 4 and 6 and the even more abstract feature of the occurrences of the n-grams is used. Statistical methods were used as well as the Naive-Bayes algorithm to find out if there is significant data in CFC. We also test our approach with real-world datasets.

> Recent statistics show that in 2015 more than 140 millions new malware samples have been found. Among these, a large portion is due to ransomware, the class of malware whose specific goal is to render the victim's system unusable, in particular by encrypting important files, and then ask the user to pay a ransom to revert the damage. Several ransomware include sophisticated packing techniques, and are hence difficult to statically analyse. We present EldeRan, a machine learning approach for dynamically analysing and classifying ransomware. EldeRan monitors a set of actions performed by applications in their first phases of installation checking for characteristics signs of ransomware. Our tests over a dataset of 582 ransomware belonging to 11 families, and with 942 goodware applications, show that EldeRan achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.995. Furthermore, EldeRan works without requiring that an entire ransomware family is available beforehand. These results suggest that dynamic analysis can support ransomware detection, since ransomware samples exhibit a set of characteristic features at run-time that are common across families, and that helps the early detection of new variants. We also outline some limitations of dynamic analysis for ransomware and propose possible solutions.

> Android is the most widely used smartphone OS with 82.8% market share in 2015. It is therefore the most widely targeted system by malware authors. Researchers rely on dynamic analysis to extract malware behaviors and often use emulators to do so. However, using emulators lead to new issues. Malware may detect emulation and as a result it does not execute the payload to prevent the analysis. Dealing with virtual device evasion is a never-ending war and comes with a non-negligible computation cost. To overcome this state of affairs, we propose a system that does not use virtual devices for analysing malware behavior. Glassbox is a functional prototype for the dynamic analysis of malware applications. It executes applications on real devices in a monitored and controlled environment. It is a fully automated system that installs, tests and extracts features from the application for further analysis. We present the architecture of the platform and we compare it with existing Android dynamic analysis platforms. Lastly, we evaluate the capacity of Glassbox to trigger application behaviors by measuring the average coverage of basic blocks on the AndroCoverage dataset. We show that it executes on average 13.52% more basic blocks than the Monkey program.

> Malware propagation poses a growing threat to networked systems such as computer networks and cyber-physical systems. Current approaches to defending against malware propagation are based on patching or filtering susceptible nodes at a fixed rate. When the propagation dynamics are unknown or uncertain, however, the static rate that is chosen may be either insufficient to remove all viruses or too high, incurring additional performance cost. In this paper, we formulate adaptive strategies for mitigating multiple malware epidemics when the propagation rate is unknown, using patching and filtering-based defense mechanisms. In order to identify conditions for ensuring that all viruses are asymptotically removed, we show that the malware propagation, patching, and filtering processes can be modeled as coupled passive dynamical systems. We prove that the patching rate required to remove all viruses is bounded above by the passivity index of the coupled system, and formulate the problem of selecting the minimum-cost mitigation strategy. Our results are evaluated through numerical study.

> It is well-known that malware constantly evolves so as to evade detection and this causes the entire malware population to be non-stationary. Contrary to this fact, prior works on machine learning based Android malware detection have assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e., features) do not change over time. In this work, we address the problem of malware population drift and propose a novel online machine learning based framework, named DroidOL to handle it and effectively detect malware. In order to perform accurate detection, security-sensitive behaviors are captured from apps in the form of inter-procedural control-flow sub-graph features using a state-of-the-art graph kernel. In order to perform scalable detection and to adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online passive-aggressive classifier is used.   In a large-scale comparative analysis with more than 87,000 apps, DroidOL achieves 84.29% accuracy outperforming two state-of-the-art malware techniques by more than 20% in their typical batch learning setting and more than 3% when they are continuously re-trained. Our experimental findings strongly indicate that online learning based approaches are highly suitable for real-world malware detection.

> Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish command and control (C&C) connections. While there are many methods to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat blind to new DGA variants.   In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect. In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based generative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, our deep learning architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector + generator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve convergence.

> Based on API call sequences, semantic-aware and machine learning (ML) based malware classifiers can be built for malware detection or classification. Previous works concentrate on crafting and extracting various features from malware binaries, disassembled binaries or API calls via static or dynamic analysis and resorting to ML to build classifiers. However, they tend to involve too much feature engineering and fail to provide interpretability. We solve these two problems with the recent advances in deep learning: 1) RNN-based autoencoders (RNN-AEs) can automatically learn low-dimensional representation of a malware from its raw API call sequence. 2) Multiple decoders can be trained under different supervisions to give more information, other than the class or family label of a malware. Inspired by the works of document classification and automatic sentence summarization, each API call sequence can be regarded as a sentence. In this paper, we make the first attempt to build a multi-task malware learning model based on API call sequences. The model consists of two decoders, one for malware classification and one for $\emph{file access pattern}$ (FAP) generation given the API call sequence of a malware. We base our model on the general seq2seq framework. Experiments show that our model can give competitive classification results as well as insightful FAP information.

> Although anti-virus software has significantly evolved over the last decade, classic signature matching based on byte patterns is still a prevalent concept for identifying security threats. Anti-virus signatures are a simple and fast detection mechanism that can complement more sophisticated analysis strategies. However, if signatures are not designed with care, they can turn from a defensive mechanism into an instrument of attack. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically deriving signatures from anti-virus software and demonstrate how the extracted signatures can be used to attack sensible data with the aid of the virus scanner itself. We study the practicability of our approach using four commercial products and exemplarily discuss a novel attack vector made possible by insufficiently designed signatures. Our research indicates that there is an urgent need to improve pattern-based signatures if used in anti-virus software and to pursue alternative detection approaches in such products.

> Recent innovations in the design of computer viruses have led to new trade-offs for the attacker. Multiple variants of a malware may spread at different rates and have different levels of visibility to the network. In this work we examine the optimal strategies for the attacker so as to trade off the extent of spread of the malware against the need for stealth. We show that in the mean-field deterministic regime, this spread-stealth trade-off is optimized by computationally simple single-threshold policies. Specifically, we show that only one variant of the malware is spread by the attacker at each time, as there exists a time up to which the attacker prioritizes maximizing the spread of the malware, and after which she prioritizes stealth.

> Let's Encrypt is a new entrant in the Certificate Authority ecosystem that offers free and automated certificate signing. It is visionary in its commitment to Certificate Transparency. In this paper, we shed light on the adoption patterns of Let's Encrypt "in the wild" and inform the future design and deployment of this exciting development in the security landscape. We analyze acquisition patterns of certificates as well as their usage and deployment trends in the real world. To this end, we analyze data from Certificate Transparency Logs containing records of more then 18 million certificates. We also leverage other sources like Censys, Alexa's historic records, Geolocation databases, and VirusTotal. We also perform active HTTPS measurements on the domains owning Let's Encrypt certificates. Our analysis of certificate acquisition shows that (1) the impact of Let's Encrypt is particularly visible in Western Europe; (2) Let's Encrypt has the potential to democratize HTTPS adoption in countries that are recent entrants to Internet adoption; (3) there is anecdotal evidence of popular domains quitting their previously untrustworthy or expensive CAs in order to transition to Let's Encrypt; and (4) there is a "heavy tailed" behavior where a small number of domains acquire a large number of certificates. With respect to usage, we find that: (1) only 54% of domains actually use the Let's Encrypt certificates they have procured; (2) there are many non-trivial incidents of server misconfigurations; and (3) there is early evidence of use of Let's Encrypt certificates for typosquatting and for malware-laden sites.

> Embedded systems permeate through nearly all aspects of modern society. From cars to refrigerators to nuclear refineries, securing these systems has never been more important. Intrusions, such as the Stuxnet malware which broke the centrifuges in Iran's Natanz refinery, can be catastrophic to not only the infected systems, but even to the wellbeing of the surrounding population. Modern day protection mechanisms for these embedded systems generally look only at protecting the network layer, and those that try to discover malware already existing on a system typically aren't efficient enough to run on a standalone embedded system. As such, we present a novel way to ensure that no malware has been inserted into an embedded system. We chaotically randomize the entire memory space of the application, interspersing watchdog-monitor programs throughout, to monitor that the core application hasn't been infiltrated. By validating the original program through conventional methods and creating a clean reset, we can ensure that any inserted malware is purged from the system with minimal effect on the given system. We also present a software prototype to validate the possibility of this approach, but given the limitations and vulnerabilities of the prototype, we also suggest a hardware alternative to the system.

> Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results.

> The growing commoditization of the underground economy has given rise to malware delivery networks, which charge fees for quickly delivering malware or unwanted software to a large number of hosts. To provide this service, a key method is the orchestration of silent delivery campaigns, which involve a group of downloaders that receive remote commands and that deliver their payloads without any user interaction. These campaigns have not been characterized systematically, unlike other aspects of malware delivery networks. Moreover, silent delivery campaigns can evade detection by relying on inconspicuous downloaders on the client side and on disposable domain names on the server side. We describe Beewolf, a system for detecting silent delivery campaigns from Internet-wide records of download events. The key observation behind our system is that the downloaders involved in these campaigns frequently retrieve payloads in lockstep. Beewolf identifies such locksteps in an unsupervised and deterministic manner. By exploiting novel techniques and empirical observations, Beewolf can operate on streaming data. We utilize Beewolf to study silent delivery campaigns at scale, on a data set of 33.3 million download events. This investigation yields novel findings, e.g. malware distributed through compromised software update channels, a substantial overlap between the delivery ecosystems for malware and unwanted software, and several types of business relationships within these ecosystems. Beewolf achieves over 92% true positives and fewer than 5% false positives. Moreover, Beewolf can detect suspicious downloaders a median of 165 days ahead of existing anti-virus products and payload-hosting domains a median of 196 days ahead of existing blacklists.

> The idea of applying machine learning(ML) to solve problems in security domains is almost 3 decades old. As information and communications grow more ubiquitous and more data become available, many security risks arise as well as appetite to manage and mitigate such risks. Consequently, research on applying and designing ML algorithms and systems for security has grown fast, ranging from intrusion detection systems(IDS) and malware classification to security policy management(SPM) and information leak checking. In this paper, we systematically study the methods, algorithms, and system designs in academic publications from 2008-2015 that applied ML in security domains. 98 percent of the surveyed papers appeared in the 6 highest-ranked academic security conferences and 1 conference known for pioneering ML applications in security. We examine the generalized system designs, underlying assumptions, measurements, and use cases in active research. Our examinations lead to 1) a taxonomy on ML paradigms and security domains for future exploration and exploitation, and 2) an agenda detailing open and upcoming challenges. Based on our survey, we also suggest a point of view that treats security as a game theory problem instead of a batch-trained ML problem.

> A number of important applied problems in engineering, finance and medicine can be formulated as a problem of anomaly detection. A classical approach to the problem is to describe a normal state using a one-class support vector machine. Then to detect anomalies we quantify a distance from a new observation to the constructed description of the normal class. In this paper we present a new approach to the one-class classification. We formulate a new problem statement and a corresponding algorithm that allow taking into account a privileged information during the training phase. We evaluate performance of the proposed approach using a synthetic dataset, as well as the publicly available Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset.

> It is possible to manipulate the headphones (or earphones) connected to a computer, silently turning them into a pair of eavesdropping microphones - with software alone. The same is also true for some types of loudspeakers. This paper focuses on this threat in a cyber-security context. We present SPEAKE(a)R, a software that can covertly turn the headphones connected to a PC into a microphone. We present technical background and explain why most of PCs and laptops are susceptible to this type of attack. We examine an attack scenario in which malware can use a computer as an eavesdropping device, even when a microphone is not present, muted, taped, or turned off. We measure the signal quality and the effective distance, and survey the defensive countermeasures.

> Mobile devices have become ubiquitous due to centralization of private user information, contacts, messages and multiple sensors. Google Android, an open-source mobile Operating System (OS), is currently the market leader. Android popularity has motivated the malware authors to employ set of cyber attacks leveraging code obfuscation techniques. Obfuscation is an action that modifies an application (app) code, preserving the original semantics and functionality to evade anti-malware. Code obfuscation is a contentious issue. Theoretical code analysis techniques indicate that, attaining a verifiable and secure obfuscation is impossible. However, obfuscation tools and techniques are popular both among malware developers (to evade anti-malware) and commercial software developers (protect intellectual rights). We conducted a survey to uncover answers to concrete and relevant questions concerning Android code obfuscation and protection techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review code obfuscation and code protection practices, and evaluate efficacy of existing code de-obfuscation tools. In particular, we discuss Android code obfuscation methods, custom app protection techniques, and various de-obfuscation methods. Furthermore, we review and analyse the obfuscation techniques used by malware authors to evade analysis efforts. We believe that, there is a need to investigate efficiency of the defense techniques used for code protection. This survey would be beneficial to the researchers and practitioners, to understand obfuscation and de-obfuscation techniques to propose novel solutions on Android.

> As our professional, social, and financial existences become increasingly digitized and as our government, healthcare, and military infrastructures rely more on computer technologies, they present larger and more lucrative targets for malware. Stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper, we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains.

> Android malware has been on the rise in recent years due to the increasing popularity of Android and the proliferation of third party application markets. Emerging Android malware families are increasingly adopting sophisticated detection avoidance techniques and this calls for more effective approaches for Android malware detection. Hence, in this paper we present and evaluate an n-gram opcode features based approach that utilizes machine learning to identify and categorize Android malware. This approach enables automated feature discovery without relying on prior expert or domain knowledge for pre-determined features. Furthermore, by using a data segmentation technique for feature selection, our analysis is able to scale up to 10-gram opcodes. Our experiments on a dataset of 2520 samples showed an f-measure of 98% using the n-gram opcode based approach. We also provide empirical findings that illustrate factors that have probable impact on the overall n-gram opcodes performance trends.

> This documents presents the final report of a two-year project to evaluate the impact of AbuseHUB, a Dutch clearinghouse for acquiring and processing abuse data on infected machines. The report was commissioned by the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, a co-funder of the development of AbuseHUB. AbuseHUB is the initiative of 9 Internet Service Providers, SIDN (the registry for the .nl top-level domain) and Surfnet (the national research and education network operator). The key objective of AbuseHUB is to improve the mitigation of botnets by its members.   We set out to assess whether this objective is being reached by analyzing malware infection levels in the networks of AbuseHUB members and comparing them to those of other Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Since AbuseHUB members together comprise over 90 percent of the broadband market in the Netherlands, it also makes sense to compare how the country as a whole has performed compared to other countries. This report complements the baseline measurement report produced in December 2013 and the interim report from March 2015. We are using the same data sources as in the interim report, which is an expanded set compared to the earlier baseline report and to our 2011 study into botnet mitigation in the Netherlands.

> Android, the most popular mobile OS, has around 78% of the mobile market share. Due to its popularity, it attracts many malware attacks. In fact, people have discovered around one million new malware samples per quarter, and it was reported that over 98% of these new malware samples are in fact "derivatives" (or variants) from existing malware families. In this paper, we first show that runtime behaviors of malware's core functionalities are in fact similar within a malware family. Hence, we propose a framework to combine "runtime behavior" with "static structures" to detect malware variants. We present the design and implementation of MONET, which has a client and a backend server module. The client module is a lightweight, in-device app for behavior monitoring and signature generation, and we realize this using two novel interception techniques. The backend server is responsible for large scale malware detection. We collect 3723 malware samples and top 500 benign apps to carry out extensive experiments of detecting malware variants and defending against malware transformation. Our experiments show that MONET can achieve around 99% accuracy in detecting malware variants. Furthermore, it can defend against 10 different obfuscation and transformation techniques, while only incurs around 7% performance overhead and about 3% battery overhead. More importantly, MONET will automatically alert users with intrusion details so to prevent further malicious behaviors.

> After the Estonian Parliamentary Elections held in 2011, an additional verification mechanism was integrated into the i-voting system in order to resist corrupted voting devices, including the so called Student's Attack where a student practically showed that the voting system is indeed not verifiable by developing several versions of malware capable of blocking or even changing the vote. This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote they cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification phase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification device. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the voter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase in detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification application may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide range, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the elections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism for the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability. Not only is the proposed mechanism secure and resistant against corrupted verification devices, so does it successfully verify whether the vote is correctly stored in the system. We also highlight that our proposed mechanism brings only symmetric encryptions and hash functions on the verification device, thereby mitigating these weaknesses in an efficient way with a negligible cost. More concretely, it brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification device, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates. Finally, we prove the security of the proposed verification mechanism and compare the cost complexity of the proposed method with that of the current mechanism.

> Software deobfuscation is a crucial activity in security analysis and especially, in malware analysis. While standard static and dynamic approaches suffer from well-known shortcomings, Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) has recently been proposed has an interesting alternative, more robust than static analysis and more complete than dynamic analysis. Yet, DSE addresses certain kinds of questions encountered by a reverser namely feasibility questions. Many issues arising during reverse, e.g. detecting protection schemes such as opaque predicates fall into the category of infeasibility questions. In this article, we present the Backward-Bounded DSE, a generic, precise, efficient and robust method for solving infeasibility questions. We demonstrate the benefit of the method for opaque predicates and call stack tampering, and give some insight for its usage for some other protection schemes. Especially, the technique has successfully been used on state-of-the-art packers as well as on the government-grade X-Tunnel malware -- allowing its entire deobfuscation. Backward-Bounded DSE does not supersede existing DSE approaches, but rather complements them by addressing infeasibility questions in a scalable and precise manner. Following this line, we propose sparse disassembly, a combination of Backward-Bounded DSE and static disassembly able to enlarge dynamic disassembly in a guaranteed way, hence getting the best of dynamic and static disassembly. This work paves the way for robust, efficient and precise disassembly tools for heavily-obfuscated binaries.

> We present DroidGen a tool for automatic anti-malware policy inference. DroidGen employs a data-driven approach: it uses a training set of malware and benign applications and makes call to a constraint solver to generate a policy under which a maximum of malware is excluded and a maximum of benign applications is allowed. Preliminary results are encouraging. We are able to automatically generate a policy which filters out 91% of the tested Android malware. Moreover, compared to black-box machine learning classifiers, our method has the advantage of generating policies in a declarative readable format. We illustrate our approach, describe its implementation and report on the preliminary results.

> A partial password is a mode of password-based authentication that is widely used, especially in the financial sector. It is based on a challenge-response protocol, where at each login attempt, a challenge requesting characters from randomly selected positions of a pre-shared secret is presented to the user. This model could be seen as a cheap way of preventing for example a malware or a key-logger installed on a user's device to learn the full password in a single step. Despite of the widespread adoption of this mechanism, especially by many UK banks, there is limited material in the open literature. Questions like how the security of the scheme varies with the sampling method employed to form the challenges or what are the existing server-side implementations are left unaddressed. In this paper, we study questions like how the security of this mechanism varies in relation to the number of challenge-response pairs available to an attacker under different ways of generating challenges. In addition, we discuss possible server-side implementations as "unofficially" listed in different online forums by information security ex- perts. To the best of our knowledge there is no formal academic literature in this direction and one of the aims of this paper is to motivate other researchers to study this topic.
